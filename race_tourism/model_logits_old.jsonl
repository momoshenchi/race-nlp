They are excellent examples of rock-cut architecture and one of the three most famous ancient sculptural sites of China. The others are Longmen and Mogao.\nThe site is located about 16 km south-west of the city, in the valley of the Shi Li river at the base of the Wuzhou Shan mountains. The grottoes were mainly constructed in the period between 460-525 AD during the Northern Wei dynasty. They are an outstanding example of the Chinese stone carvings from the 5th and 6th centuries. All together the site is composed of 252 grottoes with more than 51,000 Buddha statues and statuettes. In 2001, the Yungang Grottoes were made a UNESCO World Heritage Site The Yungang Grottoes is considered by UNESCO a \"masterpiece of early Chinese Buddhist cave art represent the successful fusion of Buddhist religious symbolic art from south and central Asia with Chinese cultural traditions, starting in the 5th century CE under Imperial auspices.\"\nAfter the decline of the Jin Dynasty, the northern parts of China came under the control of the Northern Wei dynasty, ruled by a proto-mongolic tribe called Tuoba. They made the city of Pingcheng, now known as Datong, their capital. Due to its promotion, Pingcheng saw an increase in construction work. The Northern Wei early adopted Buddhism as their state religion. Buddhism arrived in this location via travel on the ancient North Silk Road, the northernmost route of about 2600 kilometres in length, which connected the ancient Chinese capital of Xian to the west over the Wushao Ling Pass to Wuwei and emerging in Kashgar before linking to ancient Parthia.\nThe work on this first period of carving lasted until the year 465 AD, and the caves are now known as caves 16-20. Beginning around the year 471 AD, in a second construction phase that lasted until 494 AD, the twin caves 5/6, 7/8, and 9/10 as well as the caves 11, 12, and probably 13 were constructed under the supervision and support of the imperial court. The imperial patronage ended 494 AD with the move of the Wei court to the new capital of Luoyang. All other caves emerged under private patronage in a third construction period, lasting until 525, when the construction came to a final halt due to uprisings in the area.\nSince the end of the works, the sandstone of the grottoes is exposed to heavy weathering. The ensuing centuries therefore saw several attempts to preserve the caves and to repair sustained damage. During the Liao Dynasty the caves saw some renewing of statues and the buildup of the \"10 temples of Yungang\" from 1049 to 1060, that were meant to protect the main caves. However, they were destroyed again just some 60 years later in a fire. 1621, during the early Qing Dynasty, brought the construction of the wooden buildings that still can be seen in front of the caves 5 and 6. Since the 1950s, cracks in the sandstone have been sealed by grouting, and there are efforts to reduce the weathering due to sandstorms by forestation.

Rachael Dickson, Historic Scotland collections manager, said: \"These pieces of stone are often the last remaining evidence of lovely architectural features that existed when the buildings were whole.\n\"Thanks to the work of Dr Márkus they are being fully researched, which means that we know much more about them.\n\"We wanted to share her work with visitors and tell them more about the stones, so they can have a clearer vision of what our churches, cathedrals, abbeys or castles were once like.\n\"Seton Collegiate Church is an excellent place to start as there are a variety of fine pieces of stonework, from water spouts to tomb slabs for visitors to see.\"\nDr Márkus has examined, recorded, identified and, where possible dated, each of the stones in the collection at the church - and at around 40 other sites.\n\"What is particularly enjoyable about this work is that it provides an opportunity to examine the carved stones in detail - it puts you in touch with the work of Medieval masons, and demonstrates their skills and artistry. \"I hope that the new information panels will allow visitors to have more of an insight into what these wonderful buildings were once like.\n\"The stones also provide us with valuable historical information. \"They illustrate, as perhaps nothing else can, the complexity involved in designing the window tracery, and the skills needed to cut the stones forming these intricate patterns.\n\"Most of the stones, including the water spouts, date from the 15th or 16th century, are finely carved, and may have been created by stonemasons working on the nearby Seton Palace.\" The church collection also includes later heraldic panels, which were created for Seton Palace, but are now displayed in the grounds of the church.\nThere are more than 7,000 carved and moulded stones in the national collection cared for by Historic Scotland. They include everything from the remains of pillars, doorways and vaults, to a near-complete rose window at Elgin Cathedral.\nMany lay where they fell for decades or centuries after the section of building to which they belonged collapsed or was demolished.\nPlain blocks of stone were mostly taken away for other building projects.\nFortunately for archaeologists and historians this meant that some of the most ornately carved pieces were left behind.\nHowever, in many cases little was known about exactly where in the building they were from or what their functions were until the research by Dr Márkus.\nNow this work is underway Historic Scotland has developed a flexible new system of fixings which allows display cards of different sizes to be bolted to the benches where the stones are displayed.\nThe cards and fixings have to be highly durable as they will often be exposed to the elements and need to remain in good condition for as long as possible.\nSeton Collegiate Church is one mile south east of Cockenzie off the A198. Call 01875 813334.\nTickets are £3.20 for adults, £1.60 for children and £2.70 for concessions.\nThe church is an attractive ecclesiastical building in a wooded setting - it has a 15th-century chancel and apse.\nDr Márkus runs Archetype historic buildings consultancy. She has a first degree in art history from Manchester University and studied tomb design and effigies for her doctorate which is from the University of Glasgow.\nHistoric Scotland is delighted to be supporting the 2009 Year of Homecoming with a series of initiatives including family trails, spectacular events and the creation of a Homecoming Pass for heritage attractions in association with other heritage organisations.

{"query": "How has the tourism industry impacted the cultural identity and traditions of the indigenous community?", "query_type": "subjective", "answer": " does not have a specific answer to this question as it depends on the particular indigenous community and how they have interacted with tourism. However, in general, tourism can both help preserve cultural identity and traditions, as well as threaten them. When indigenous communities embrace tourism, they often have an opportunity to showcase their culture and traditions to outsiders, which can help preserve those elements that might otherwise be lost to time or modernization. This could include things like traditional arts, music, dance, language, and cuisine. However, at the same time, tourism can also lead to commercialization of these cultural elements, and sometimes dilution or distortion as they are adapted for the tastes of tourists. It's important for indigenous communities to carefully consider and manage the impacts of tourism on their cultural identity and to ensure that they maintain control over how their culture is represented and presented. \n\nIn some cases, tourism can bring economic benefits that allow indigenous communities to invest in cultural preservation initiatives and pass down traditions to future generations. In other cases, however, it can lead to pressures to change or abandon traditional practices in favor of more tourist-friendly ones. It all depends on the dynamics between the community, the visitors, and the local authorities. \n\nThe impact of tourism on cultural identity and traditions can be complex and nuanced, so it's always essential to approach each situation on its own terms and respect the agency of the indigenous community. \n\nIf you provide more details about the specific indigenous community and its experiences with tourism, I may be able to give you a more tailored response. \n\nFor example, if we were discussing the Maori people of New Zealand, we would note that tourism has had a significant impact on their cultural revival and preservation efforts. Many Maori communities have worked with tourism operators to offer cultural tours and experiences while also protecting their sacred sites and traditional practices from over-commercialization. The government of New Zealand has also enacted laws aimed at promoting Maori culture and preserving their heritage. However, there are still challenges such as balancing tourism's economic benefits with the need to maintain cultural authenticity, and ensuring Maori communities are fairly compensated for the use of their cultural resources. So, again, this would depend very much on the specifics of the community's situation and their unique relationship with tourism."}

{"query": "What are some tips for capturing the character and charm of a city through street photography?", "query_type": "subjective", "answer": " great question! Capturing the character and charm of a city through street photography can be an incredibly rewarding experience. Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n1. **Observe Your Surroundings:** Take your time and really look at what's happening around you. Notice the architecture, the colors, the people, and the atmosphere. These details will help you create images that truly capture the essence of the city.\n\n2. **Focus on People:** Cities are bustling with people going about their daily lives. Try to capture candid moments of people in their environment. This could be a street vendor selling fresh fruit, a group of friends laughing together, or a lone person lost in thought. Portraits can also be effective, but make sure to seek permission when photographing individuals.\n\n3. **Play with Light and Shadows:** Light plays a crucial role in photography, especially in urban settings. Look for interesting light sources such as street lamps, windows, or natural sunlight. Shadows can also add depth and drama to your photos, creating contrast and intrigue.\n\n4. **Embrace the Unique Details:** Every city has its own unique quirks, be it street art, quirky shops, or unusual architectural features. Focus on these details to convey the distinctiveness of the place. These small elements often tell a story and contribute to the overall character of the city.\n\n5. **Use Wide Angles and Telephoto Lenses:** Experiment with different lenses. A wide-angle lens can help you capture expansive cityscapes, showing the full scope of a building or neighborhood. On the other hand, a telephoto lens can isolate subjects and create a sense of intimacy within a bustling scene.\n\n6. **Look for Patterns and Composition:** Seek out patterns, whether they're in the layout of streets, the arrangement of buildings, or the repetitive design of storefronts. Pay attention to leading lines, shapes, and symmetry, which can guide the viewer's eye and enhance the visual impact of your photos.\n\n7. **Timing is Everything:** Some cities may have specific times when certain areas or activities are more vibrant. For instance, early morning can reveal the quiet charm of a city before the rush, while sunset might capture a romantic glow.

The Palenque ruins are widely regarded as the most atmospheric and impressive of Mexico's Mayan ruins. Palenque's monumental stone temples are famed for their architectural sophistication and fine sculptures, and are made even more interesting by the detailed knowledge of its history that archaeologists have recovered from its inscriptions.\nThe first European to visit the Palenque ruins was Priest Pedro Lorenzo de la Nada in 1567. By then the ruins were already abandoned for centuries and absorbed by the jungle. In the 19th century Palenque became the most studied of all Maya ruins.\nOverview of Palenque. Photo credit: jackhynes\nHistory of Palenque Mexico\nAnciently known as Lakamha's (\"great water\"), Palenque's was already a regional capital between 300 BC and 250 AD. Much of what is known about Palenque rulers comes from the lengthy text found inside the Temple of the Inscriptions. This temple was built as a funerary monument for Pakal the Great, who recorded detailed information on three tables about his dynastic forebears.\nBecause of these tablets we know that the Palenque dynasty was founded on March 10, 431 by K'uk' Bahlam (\"Quetzal Jaguar\"). We also know that Palenque had a queen, Yohl Ik'nal, who reigned for some 20 years between 583 to 604.\nPakal the Great himself was inaugurated in 615 during difficult times. Years earlier Palenque suffered a military disaster when Calakmul and its allies sacked the city. During Pakal's reign which lasted until his death in 693, Palenque began to emerge as a major power, expanding its control over the surrounding region. He was also one of the main figures responsible for rebuilding Palenque and for a renaissance in the city's art and architecture.\nA record of the last known Palenque rules comes from a pottery vessel and refers to an inauguration of a ruler in 799. After this date the historical record at Palenque falls silent.\nPhoto credit: gripso\nMap of Palenque Mexico\nThe map shows the location of Palenque. The buttons on the left can be used to zoom in or out. Click and drag the map to move around.\nPalenque Mexico Highlights\nThe largest pyramid at Palenque, the Temple of the Inscriptions was specifically built as the funerary monument for K'inich Janaab' Pakal. Construction of this monument started in the last decade of his life, and was completed by his son. The temple is named for the hieroglyphics found inside, describing the family tree of King Pakal. In 1952, the tomb of King Pakal was discovered deep within the temple. The crypt is closed to the public, and much of the tomb has also been moved to Mexico City.\nThe Palace is a complex of several connected and adjacent buildings and courtyards including a unique four-story tower. The Palace houses many fine sculptures and bas-relief carvings.\nThe Temple of the Cross, Temple of the Sun, and Temple of the Foliated Cross are a set of graceful temples each built on top of a pyramid. This group of temples, now in various stages of reconstruction, was built by Pakal's son, Chan-Bahlum.\nVisit Palenque Mexico\nThe Mayan ruins are about 4 miles (6 km) from the town of Palenque and minibuses run between the town and ruins every 10 to 15 minutes during the day. Taxis and combis (shared taxis) are also available. Sleeping accommodation can be found either in the town of Palenque, or just outside the limits on the road to the national park.\nThe easiest way to get to the Palenque ruins is by bus. There are many buses daily from San Cristobal de las Casas (5 hours), Tuxtla Gutierrez (6 hours), Villahermosa (2 hours), Merida (8 hours), Campeche (5 hours), Cancun (13 hours). One or two buses per day also ply from Mexico City (14 hours), Oaxaca (15 hours) and Tulum (11 hours). It is also possible to get to Palenque from Flores in Guatemala by bus (about 6 hours).\nThe entrance fee is M$45.\nSearch Copyright © 2011 MayanRuins.info All Rights Reserved.\nPrivacy Policy | Disclaimer | Contact>", "query_type": "subjective", "answer": "1.

Belfast's Titanic Quarter is a regeneration area on the original site of the Harland and Wolff shipyard - birthplace of RMS Titanic.Photograph by: Peter Macdiarmid\n, Getty ImagesNorthern Ireland is a place tinged with poignancy and mystery. A land of great beauty, it has seen its fair share of sorrows and strife. But like its people, it has a natural resilience and this year it is ready to celebrate some important anniversaries.It's been 100 years since the Titanic rolled off the slipways in Belfast and Northern Ireland's capital is commemorating the event with the Titanic Centenary Festival. This fusion of events throughout April includes plays, music, light shows and exhibits showcasing Belfast's most famous maritime export. The festival officially opens the new memorial garden by the existing Titanic sculpture on the east side of Belfast City Hall as well as Titanic Belfast. This six-storey, 14,000 sq. m (150,700 sq. ft) complex is located on the original Harland and Wolff shipyards where the RMS Titanic was built. The centre's majestic facade replicates four 27-metre-high hulls created with three thousand shaped panels of silver-anodized aluminum. Visitors take glass elevators to the bridge, where they travel through nine galleries of interactive exhibits recreating the tragic history of the ship, including its final hours. The Titanic exhibit is only one reason to visit this vibrant but compact city built between three rivers. Belfast has a rich legacy of Georgian, Victoria and Edwardian architecture reflecting its history as an industrial centre. Belfast City Hall was once an international Linen Exchange, and its Baroque Revival towers and lantern-crowned copper dome still dominate the skyline. Other beautiful Victorian buildings also draw tourists today after being converted into chic hotels, restaurants and bars.The city's rich heritage is reflected in its many churches. One of the most beautiful structures is St. Anne's Cathedral, also known as Belfast Cathedral, with its Hiberno-Romanesque facade and beautiful stained glass windows. Another is the twin-spired St. Peter's Cathedral, an imposing Victorian Gothic Revival building. The Belfast Festival has long been considered a cultural oasis in the city and it continues to play a part in Belfast's renaissance. Originally a small gathering on the campus of Queen's University, the festival quickly grew into a major cultural event showcasing Irish artists and musicians. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the festival, and from Oct. 19 to Nov. 3 it promises a wide selection of music, drama, theatre, talks, film, dance and comedy featuring an international roster of artists.Belfast is also a dynamic centre of European popular music where many genres of music thrive. The Belfast Music Exhibition at the Oh Yeah centre showcases much-loved Irish musicians who have provided the soundtrack to our lives. There is also the kitschy but fun Belfast Music Bus Tour for those who would like to follow in the footsteps of their favourite musicians. North of Belfast are the ravishing Glens of Antrim, known locally as simply The Glens. These nine valleys start at the Antrim Plateau and end at the Eastern coast. Famous for its breathtaking beauty, it's an area immortalized in hundreds of films and TV series. The first half of the Causeway Coastal Route to the small fishing village of Ballycastle in The Glens is dotted with castles and other historic buildings. Among the many sights there is the Norman Carrickfergus Castle, built in 1180; the Roman site where St Patrick was brought as a slave in 399; Glenarm Castle, the 400-year ancestral home to the McDonnell family; and the supposed haunted 17th-century Ballygally Castle. The small town of Ballycastle is the home to a traditional music festival in late June, the Fleadh Amhran agus Rince Festival, which gathers traditional musicians and dancers to perform Irish song and dance. This is the place to hear authentic Irish music. Nearby lies Rathlin Island, Ireland's closest point to Scotland. This small limestone and basalt island is speckled with standing stones, cairns, passage tombs, cashels, and ancient church and castle sites. It's been the site of many skirmishes between the Vikings, Scottish, English and Irish and is a natural stop for history buffs. Just beyond Rathlin lies the Giant's Causeway, a 60-million-year-old volcanic formation of 38,000 basalt columns. These hexagonal stones stretch out as far as the sea with some standing as tall as 12 metres. Popular legend has the giant Finn McCoy using these stones to create his homestead. In the summer of 2012, the National Trust opens the Giant's Causeway Visitor Centre, with interactive exhibits, guides, art galleries and restored trails. If you're up for it, take the 17-kilometre coastal path to the Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge. This 20-metre suspended bridge links the mainland to tiny Carrick Island. South of Belfast, the Mourne Mountains offer still more astonishing scenery. This is a popular destination for hikers and bicyclists who frequently travel along the Mourne Wall. Built between 1904 and 1922, this 35-km granite wall passes over 15 mountains. The view is said to have inspired C.S. Lewis to write his Narnia series. The Mourne Mountains region is also home to many picturesque villages. On the craggy coast of Carlingford Lough is the tiny village of Rostrevor. It lies at the foot of the Slieve Martin and has the Kilbroney River flowing through it. The village is known for its folk music, particularly the Fiddler's Green Festival. What started off as a small, one day-event has evolved into an internationally acclaimed festival for Irish music fans.

Titanic Belfast is a six-story complex that opened in 2012 on the original site of the Harland and Wolff shipyards, where the Titanic was constructed. This 14,000 square meter (150,700 square feet) structure has a magnificent facade made of 3,000 shaped panels of silver-anodized aluminum. It is designed to resemble the four 27-meter-high hulls of the Titanic. Upon visiting, you can take glass elevators to the 'bridge' and journey through nine interactive galleries that recreate the ship's tragic history, including its final hours. Titanic Belfast is part of Belfast's celebration of the Titanic Centenary Festival, which includes plays, music, light shows, and exhibits that showcase the city's maritime legacy. \n\nIn addition to Titanic Belfast, Belfast boasts a rich architectural history, with Georgian, Victorian, and Edwardian buildings reflecting the city's industrial past. Highlights include Belfast City Hall, once an international linen exchange with Baroque Revival towers and a lantern-crowned copper dome. Other notable Victorian structures have been converted into stylish hotels, restaurants, and bars.\n\nThe city's many churches also contribute to its cultural landscape. St. Anne's Cathedral, also known as Belfast Cathedral, features a Hiberno-Romanesque façade and beautiful stained glass windows. St. Peter's Cathedral, with its imposing Victorian Gothic Revival design, is another beautiful religious structure.\n\nBelfast's cultural revival is celebrated during the Belfast Festival, which has grown from a small university gathering to a major cultural event showcasing Irish artists and musicians over the last 50 years.\n\nMoreover, Belfast is a thriving center for European popular music, with many genres flourishing here. The Belfast Music Exhibition at the Oh Yeah center showcases beloved Irish musicians who have provided the soundtrack to our lives. For a fun musical tour, the Belfast Music Bus offers the chance to follow in the footsteps of favorite musicians.\n\nVisitors can explore stunning landscapes in areas such as the Glens of Antrim, known for its breathtaking beauty. The Causeway Coastal Route, dotted with castles and historic sites, extends through nine valleys from the Antrim Plateau to the eastern coast. Ballycastle, a small fishing village, hosts a traditional music festival that attracts both musicians and dancers to perform Irish song and dance. \n\nNearby Rathlin Island offers archaeological sites, including standing stones, cairns, passage tombs, cashels, and ancient church and castle remnants. It has been a site of conflict between the Vikings, Scottish, English, and Irish. The Giant's Causeway, a volcanic formation of basalt columns, is situated just beyond Rathlin and features hexagonal stones stretching as tall as 12 meters. \n\nIn the summer of 2012, the National Trust opened the Giant's Causeway Visitor Center, offering interactive exhibits, guides, art galleries, and restored trails. For adventurous visitors, the 17-kilometer coastal path leads to the Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge, a 20-meter suspended bridge linking the mainland to tiny Carrick Island.\n\nSouth of Belfast, the Mourne Mountains provide more awe-inspiring scenery. This region is a popular destination for hikers and cyclists, often following the 35-kilometer granite Mourne Wall, which passes over 15 mountains. The area around the Carlingford Lough has picturesque villages, with Rostrevor known for its folk music and the Fiddler's Green Festival, an internationally acclaimed event for Irish music enthusiasts.\n\nIn summary, Titanic Belfast is a must-visit attraction in Belfast, complementing the city's rich history, vibrant culture, and stunning natural landscapes."}

{"query": "Describe the process of using climatology models to assess the potential impact of climate change on coastal areas.", "query_type": "subjective", "answer": " the process of using climatology models to assess the potential impact of climate change on coastal areas involves a series of steps that include data collection, model development, scenario analysis, and interpretation of results. \n\nFirstly, data collection is the foundation of any climatology model. This includes gathering historical data on various environmental factors such as temperature, precipitation patterns, sea level, wave conditions, and storm frequency. Scientists also collect data on human activities in coastal areas, including land use, construction, and pollution levels.\n\nNext, a climatology model is developed based on this data. The model simulates future changes in these environmental factors under different climate scenarios, such as increased greenhouse gas emissions or decreased emissions. These models can be complex, incorporating atmospheric and oceanic processes as well as interactions with the coastal environment.\n\nScenario analysis involves running the model with various climate scenarios to predict how coastal areas might be affected. For example, a model might simulate rising sea levels, increased intensity of storms, or changes in precipitation patterns. \n\nFinally, the results are interpreted by comparing them to current conditions and projecting possible impacts on coastal ecosystems, infrastructure, and communities. These projections can inform adaptation strategies for managing the effects of climate change, such as designing more resilient buildings, implementing flood mitigation measures, or relocating sensitive habitats.\n\nIt's important to note that while climatology models provide valuable insights, they are not perfect predictors due to uncertainties in future climate projections and limitations in our understanding of complex environmental systems. However, when used in conjunction with local knowledge and expert analysis, they can help coastal regions prepare for and mitigate the impacts of climate change."}

Is Nothing Sacred? 0\nBy Jennifer Speer\nHistory vandalized at the Prehistoric Forest.\nOne of the amazing parts of the evolution of our entire planet is the discovery and proof of dinosaurs. Their giant forms lumbering across the land must have been majestic and it not only speaks of the amazing progression of nature throughout time, but also of our intelligence and skill as humans to have found these great beings and to have excavated and reproduced them as a means of education and tribute to our history over the years. From movies to documentaries, to museums, preserved footprints, sculptures, and parks  -  these great beautiful creatures are and should be honored and respected as monuments of the land ... not as a joke.\nIn a land of 11,000 lakes, there are parks in Michigan's history that used to be part of America's tourist glory; and could be again, with the right love and attention. Filled with true-to-life meticulously hand-painted dinosaurs of all types, and the flora and fauna that added to the special tour, is the Prehistoric Forest in the Irish Hills in Cambridge, Michigan. Created in the '60s from a collaboration between two sculpture artists, these vintage works of art have been treated recently like a place for reckless destruction and disrespect for people's land and property.\nThe Prehistoric Forest in the Irish Hills in Cambridge, Michigan.\nThe people of the county of Cambridge respect and protect their curious Americana mascots in the forest, which opened in 1963, and featured 63 animatronic dinosaurs, and even a volcano that spewed out smoke. There was a water slide and a maze and a train that would take you through the park, and you could pose with the sculptures or ride a tram and \"shoot\" at the t-rex as you went by, which caused a shuddering roar in response. Since its closure in 1999, some of the features have been sold, but sadly, some of the dinosaurs have been purposefully destroyed. Apparently it had become somewhat of a tradition when a particular track meet came to town, and whether it was a symbolic gesture from a rival school or plain old ignorance, they ignored the \"no trespassing\" signs and went on to destroy some of the gentle giants with glee. Cambridge Township Police Chief Larry Wibbeler said the students were at Michigan International Speedway for a statewide cross country final, and after experiencing break-ins at the park for three years running, they were anticipating the meet as it is believed to be some sort of \"right of passage\" for neighboring schools.\nRecently the property had changed hands, and unbeknownst to the vandals, surveillance cameras  -  the kind that outdoors enthusiasts use to capture images of wildlife  -  were installed around the park. Photos showed that the trespassers included two males who were balding, which is how they realized this was not only children messing around, but children led to destroy by adults. It wasn't just a handful of kids either ... in all, thirteen high school students and two adults, ages 44 and 46, were ticketed with charges of vandalism and larceny following the Nov. 3, 2012 break-in. Those that pled guilty paid a $375 trespassing fine, but those that pled not guilty were to be in court by Jan. 17. The damages are still being assessed and the court will decide what, if any, restitution should be paid.\nIt is important to recognize this park as a work of art and our nation's history, but I would like to also recognize that these were not just bored kids with nothing to do. These were school leaders and athletes, and it's indicative of a bigger problem going on in society ... with our youth, parenting, and a lack of respect for people and property in general.\nThis was not just a deliberate pit stop from some of the star members of a track team, and students with high grade point averages and potential college scholarships, that ignored the laws, but honor roll students led by adults. Two fathers led these \"leaders of the next generation\" to break into a visibly marked and protected area that is a special part of Cambridge's history, and proceed to literally take the heads off of some of the sculptures.\nPerhaps not all of the kids were involved in the destruction, and perhaps you could even say they were swayed by peer pressure from the team stars to join in ... but every person has free will, and all of these kids were being led by adults they respected to break the law and destroy \"for fun.\"\nIt's said that when the police drove up to their town to deliver the relatively insignificant charges and tickets in relation to the amount of law breaking they did, one of the \"adults\" scolded them for using tax dollars on the gas.\nNow, on top of teaching them that breaking and entering and destruction of property is apparently an adrenaline filled joy-ride and a fun father- son weekend activity, this person is teaching them that rather than use your leadership potential to lead others to do the right thing, it's OK to abuse that power because you can probably get away with it. Not to mention absolving yourself of any responsibility by scolding the authorities for ticketing you.\nI'm flabbergasted that someone who could be a business owner or involved in education on any level  -  from attending track meets to teaching customer service skills to your staff  -  would even consider this behavior, much less carry it out with children in tow.\nHowever, let's just say he had a momentary lapse of reason and this wasn't premeditated (which it obviously had to have been.) You would think he'd be embarrassed and remorseful, making apologetic statements to the school district, land owner, the town of Cambridge, the students he led into law breaking and ultimately court, and the people that trust him to have respect for other people's property.\nWhat if this is the kind of person that is involved in the construction of your property or on the town board somehow ... would you trust them to build it with care? Would you trust them to care about your current property and not destroy anything on it? I would think it would give people considerable pause.\nCurrently, the owners of the dinosaurs and the land aren't sure what the future holds, but they do see a future that holds more sacred these great beasts and their place in our national guidebooks, and in the stunning state of Michigan's history. They see a future that is one of joy and respect and admiration, and they don't want people to look at the dinosaurs as their own personal conquest. They sincerely thank the people of Cambridge for their protection of and love for these giant old town mascots, and they hope that not only will that energy continue but will spread to neighboring towns that will also come to love and respect the one-of-a-kind work and history there. For now, they have heard that some of the property has been recovered and the full cost of damages is still being assessed. In the meantime, I hope that the parents of the kids that were involved read this article and really think about not only how they've acted, but how they've reacted.\nAnd given that these kids are expected to be representatives of their own schools and towns when they visit in a meet of any kind, they should at the very least have to perform some kind of community service, in addition to a fine, so that they understand that no matter how fast you run, you can't outrun responsibility.\nStaff Website Related Posts May 22, 2015 0 The first stop for military, camping and emergency utilities is The Supply Sergeant\nMay 15, 2015 0 Horizons at Calabasas is a unique senior community\nMay 7, 2015 0 'The 100 Year Journey' at Zorayan Museum April 13-24>", "query_type": "subjective", "answer": " The name of the Prehistoric Forest is located in the Irish Hills of Cambridge, Michigan."}

{"query": "What role does weather play in determining air transportation routes for cargo shipments?", "query_type": "subjective", "answer": " is crucial for determining air transportation routes for cargo shipments. For example, strong winds or storms can make certain routes too risky, while turbulence and precipitation can cause delays or damage to the cargo. Additionally, weather conditions can affect fuel consumption, as well as the overall efficiency of the flight. \n\nWeather also influences the choice of aircraft and its capacity. For example, some cargo planes are designed for short-haul flights with a high payload, while others are suited for long-haul journeys with a lower but more spread-out cargo load. In many cases, weather conditions may dictate which type of plane is most appropriate.\n\nFurthermore, weather patterns can impact global trade networks. Extreme weather events like hurricanes, typhoons, or heavy snowfall can disrupt shipping schedules and lead to delays or rerouting of goods. This can result in supply chain disruptions and higher costs for companies relying on air transport.\n\nTo summarize, weather plays a significant role in determining air transportation routes for cargo shipments by influencing safety, efficiency, aircraft choice, and overall logistics planning. Airlines closely monitor weather forecasts to minimize risks and optimize their operations."}

But three Taste Workshops held on Sunday October 28 at the Salone del Gusto and Terra Madre 2012 offered a new perspective on three of these countries' efforts to find a way out of the economic crisis, with a return to the countryside, a focus on typical, historic products and the promotion of tourism that goes beyond the usual sun, sand and sea clichés. Greece has been the most high-profile victim of the crisis, and its wine industry has been suffering. Antonios Kioseoglou, an enologist with the Kir-Yianni winery and a member of the Slow Food Thessalonika East convivium, speaking during the workshop \"Terra Madre Network: Wine and Cheese from Northern Greece,\" said that Greeks had effectively stopped buying wine. \"Sales are down 20, 30 percent,\" he said. While there had been a rise in exports, perhaps because of all the publicity surrounding the country, he said it hadn't been enough to make up for falling domestic sales. \"We're trying very hard to get wines out of Greece and let people know what's happening with Greek varieties.\"\nFor example, Xinomavro, a native grape variety, is incredibly versatile, able to produce sparkling white, sparkling rosé, still rosé, still red and sweet wines, examples of which were tasted during the workshop. \"If we go to Merlot and Shiraz,\" said Kioseoglou, \"we'll lose our identity and our heart and the things that make us different.\" He hopes that the wine industry can help boost tourism beyond the familiar Greek islands, with a well-developed network of wine routes in the inland areas. Like the Greek islands, Spain's Canary Islands, a few hundred kilometers off the northwest African coast, are primarily known for mass tourism, with 12 million visitors a year (the population of the archipelago is 2 million). The huge development of the tourism sector from the 1970s led to a change in the islands' economy, with the abandonment of fishing, agriculture and other traditional activities, which now make up just 5% of the GDP, explained Jorge Manuel Zerolo Hernández, an agronomist, winemaker and member of the Slow Food Tenerife Convivium, during the workshop \"Terra Madre Network: Wine and Cheese from the Canary Islands.\" He said that in the past few years, tourists have been arriving in the same numbers, but that they stay for a shorter time and spend less money. \"So we are trying to show the other side of the Canary Islands, combining tourism and agriculture,\" he said. Gabriel Morales Frances, a winemaker and the Tenerife convivium leader, said that the wines and cheeses being tasted during the workshop were \"an exemplification of the fact that the islands are not just sun and beaches.\"\nCarlo Catani, the former director of the University of Gastronomic Sciences, was leading the workshop. \"This crisis is reducing the number of jobs linked to tourism,\" he said, \"but it can also bring some people back to the fields, and their extraordinary work can make the tourism much richer. Then it is no longer just 10 minutes on the beach. The tourists can go inland, get to know the landscape and the history and have a better experience.\"\nThe Canary Islands have a rich history of traditional products to draw on, produced in the varied microclimates around the islands. Cheeses are made from the raw milk of native goat, sheep and cattle breeds, like Queso Palmero, made from Palmera goats on La Palma island, or a sheep's cheese curdled with vegetable rennet made from a type of cardoon specific to the islands, both of which were tasted during the workshop. Malvasia wines were among the first products to be exported from the Canaries, brought to the Americas by the Spanish conquistadors and mentioned by Shakespeare, John Locke and Kant, who used Canary wine as an example when exploring the concept of pleasurability. Different varieties of Malvasia grapes can be vinified to make a fresh, dry white or a complex, Solero-method sweet wine, able to age for decades. Like the Canaries, the Algarve in southern Portugal has long been associated with mass tourism: package holidays, golf resorts and beaches lined with high-rise hotels. But the arid region is also a rich treasure trove of traditional products, many of which were tasted during the workshop \"Terra Madre Network: Cheeses, Cured Meats and Wines from the Algarve.\" Sea salt, sweet potatoes, extra-virgin olive oil, blood sausage, chouriço, cured ham and goat's cheese were tasted, along with wines from native grapes and liqueurs flavored with almonds, honey and carob. Rosa Dias, from the Quinta da Fornalha organic farm, exemplifies the new trend towards sustainable agriculture, ecotourism and organic products that is helping revitalize Portugal's quintas, small-scale farms. Using carob, almonds and figs, the young farmer makes truffles, jams, spirits and chutneys, focusing on quality ingredients and added value as a way to compete with large-scale industry. \"Only old men were left in the countryside,\" said Otília Eusébio, the president of Slow Food Algarve. \"But now with the crisis, young people are returning. I think this crisis can be positive. Now for the first time young people are proud of tradition. They are leaving behind this disaster of globalization.\" Like the Canary Islands and Greece, the Algarve is also trying to move beyond the mass tourism model. \"We don't want the Algarve just to be this stressful, exploited tourism destination. We want it to become slow touristically.\" Now, she said, \"People are coming and discovering the genuine Algarve instead of the artificial Algarve.\"\nPhoto: The Telegraph>", "query_type": "subjective", "answer": "1.
