They are excellent examples of rock-cut architecture and one of the three most famous ancient sculptural sites of China. The others are Longmen and Mogao.\nThe site is located about 16 km south-west of the city, in the valley of the Shi Li river at the base of the Wuzhou Shan mountains. The grottoes were mainly constructed in the period between 460-525 AD during the Northern Wei dynasty. They are an outstanding example of the Chinese stone carvings from the 5th and 6th centuries. All together the site is composed of 252 grottoes with more than 51,000 Buddha statues and statuettes. In 2001, the Yungang Grottoes were made a UNESCO World Heritage Site The Yungang Grottoes is considered by UNESCO a \"masterpiece of early Chinese Buddhist cave art represent the successful fusion of Buddhist religious symbolic art from south and central Asia with Chinese cultural traditions, starting in the 5th century CE under Imperial auspices.\"\nAfter the decline of the Jin Dynasty, the northern parts of China came under the control of the Northern Wei dynasty, ruled by a proto-mongolic tribe called Tuoba. They made the city of Pingcheng, now known as Datong, their capital. Due to its promotion, Pingcheng saw an increase in construction work. The Northern Wei early adopted Buddhism as their state religion. Buddhism arrived in this location via travel on the ancient North Silk Road, the northernmost route of about 2600 kilometres in length, which connected the ancient Chinese capital of Xian to the west over the Wushao Ling Pass to Wuwei and emerging in Kashgar before linking to ancient Parthia.\nThe work on this first period of carving lasted until the year 465 AD, and the caves are now known as caves 16-20. Beginning around the year 471 AD, in a second construction phase that lasted until 494 AD, the twin caves 5/6, 7/8, and 9/10 as well as the caves 11, 12, and probably 13 were constructed under the supervision and support of the imperial court. The imperial patronage ended 494 AD with the move of the Wei court to the new capital of Luoyang. All other caves emerged under private patronage in a third construction period, lasting until 525, when the construction came to a final halt due to uprisings in the area.\nSince the end of the works, the sandstone of the grottoes is exposed to heavy weathering. The ensuing centuries therefore saw several attempts to preserve the caves and to repair sustained damage. During the Liao Dynasty the caves saw some renewing of statues and the buildup of the \"10 temples of Yungang\" from 1049 to 1060, that were meant to protect the main caves. However, they were destroyed again just some 60 years later in a fire. 1621, during the early Qing Dynasty, brought the construction of the wooden buildings that still can be seen in front of the caves 5 and 6. Since the 1950s, cracks in the sandstone have been sealed by grouting, and there are efforts to reduce the weathering due to sandstorms by forestation.

Rachael Dickson, Historic Scotland collections manager, said: \"These pieces of stone are often the last remaining evidence of lovely architectural features that existed when the buildings were whole.\n\"Thanks to the work of Dr Márkus they are being fully researched, which means that we know much more about them.\n\"We wanted to share her work with visitors and tell them more about the stones, so they can have a clearer vision of what our churches, cathedrals, abbeys or castles were once like.\n\"Seton Collegiate Church is an excellent place to start as there are a variety of fine pieces of stonework, from water spouts to tomb slabs for visitors to see.\"\nDr Márkus has examined, recorded, identified and, where possible dated, each of the stones in the collection at the church - and at around 40 other sites.\n\"What is particularly enjoyable about this work is that it provides an opportunity to examine the carved stones in detail - it puts you in touch with the work of Medieval masons, and demonstrates their skills and artistry. \"I hope that the new information panels will allow visitors to have more of an insight into what these wonderful buildings were once like.\n\"The stones also provide us with valuable historical information. \"They illustrate, as perhaps nothing else can, the complexity involved in designing the window tracery, and the skills needed to cut the stones forming these intricate patterns.\n\"Most of the stones, including the water spouts, date from the 15th or 16th century, are finely carved, and may have been created by stonemasons working on the nearby Seton Palace.\" The church collection also includes later heraldic panels, which were created for Seton Palace, but are now displayed in the grounds of the church.\nThere are more than 7,000 carved and moulded stones in the national collection cared for by Historic Scotland. They include everything from the remains of pillars, doorways and vaults, to a near-complete rose window at Elgin Cathedral.\nMany lay where they fell for decades or centuries after the section of building to which they belonged collapsed or was demolished.\nPlain blocks of stone were mostly taken away for other building projects.\nFortunately for archaeologists and historians this meant that some of the most ornately carved pieces were left behind.\nHowever, in many cases little was known about exactly where in the building they were from or what their functions were until the research by Dr Márkus.\nNow this work is underway Historic Scotland has developed a flexible new system of fixings which allows display cards of different sizes to be bolted to the benches where the stones are displayed.\nThe cards and fixings have to be highly durable as they will often be exposed to the elements and need to remain in good condition for as long as possible.\nSeton Collegiate Church is one mile south east of Cockenzie off the A198. Call 01875 813334.\nTickets are £3.20 for adults, £1.60 for children and £2.70 for concessions.\nThe church is an attractive ecclesiastical building in a wooded setting - it has a 15th-century chancel and apse.\nDr Márkus runs Archetype historic buildings consultancy. She has a first degree in art history from Manchester University and studied tomb design and effigies for her doctorate which is from the University of Glasgow.\nHistoric Scotland is delighted to be supporting the 2009 Year of Homecoming with a series of initiatives including family trails, spectacular events and the creation of a Homecoming Pass for heritage attractions in association with other heritage organisations.

The Palenque ruins are widely regarded as the most atmospheric and impressive of Mexico's Mayan ruins. Palenque's monumental stone temples are famed for their architectural sophistication and fine sculptures, and are made even more interesting by the detailed knowledge of its history that archaeologists have recovered from its inscriptions.\nThe first European to visit the Palenque ruins was Priest Pedro Lorenzo de la Nada in 1567. By then the ruins were already abandoned for centuries and absorbed by the jungle. In the 19th century Palenque became the most studied of all Maya ruins.\nOverview of Palenque. Photo credit: jackhynes\nHistory of Palenque Mexico\nAnciently known as Lakamha's (\"great water\"), Palenque's was already a regional capital between 300 BC and 250 AD. Much of what is known about Palenque rulers comes from the lengthy text found inside the Temple of the Inscriptions. This temple was built as a funerary monument for Pakal the Great, who recorded detailed information on three tables about his dynastic forebears.\nBecause of these tablets we know that the Palenque dynasty was founded on March 10, 431 by K'uk' Bahlam (\"Quetzal Jaguar\"). We also know that Palenque had a queen, Yohl Ik'nal, who reigned for some 20 years between 583 to 604.\nPakal the Great himself was inaugurated in 615 during difficult times. Years earlier Palenque suffered a military disaster when Calakmul and its allies sacked the city. During Pakal's reign which lasted until his death in 693, Palenque began to emerge as a major power, expanding its control over the surrounding region. He was also one of the main figures responsible for rebuilding Palenque and for a renaissance in the city's art and architecture.\nA record of the last known Palenque rules comes from a pottery vessel and refers to an inauguration of a ruler in 799. After this date the historical record at Palenque falls silent.\nPhoto credit: gripso\nMap of Palenque Mexico\nThe map shows the location of Palenque. The buttons on the left can be used to zoom in or out. Click and drag the map to move around.\nPalenque Mexico Highlights\nThe largest pyramid at Palenque, the Temple of the Inscriptions was specifically built as the funerary monument for K'inich Janaab' Pakal. Construction of this monument started in the last decade of his life, and was completed by his son. The temple is named for the hieroglyphics found inside, describing the family tree of King Pakal. In 1952, the tomb of King Pakal was discovered deep within the temple. The crypt is closed to the public, and much of the tomb has also been moved to Mexico City.\nThe Palace is a complex of several connected and adjacent buildings and courtyards including a unique four-story tower. The Palace houses many fine sculptures and bas-relief carvings.\nThe Temple of the Cross, Temple of the Sun, and Temple of the Foliated Cross are a set of graceful temples each built on top of a pyramid. This group of temples, now in various stages of reconstruction, was built by Pakal's son, Chan-Bahlum.\nVisit Palenque Mexico\nThe Mayan ruins are about 4 miles (6 km) from the town of Palenque and minibuses run between the town and ruins every 10 to 15 minutes during the day. Taxis and combis (shared taxis) are also available. Sleeping accommodation can be found either in the town of Palenque, or just outside the limits on the road to the national park.\nThe easiest way to get to the Palenque ruins is by bus. There are many buses daily from San Cristobal de las Casas (5 hours), Tuxtla Gutierrez (6 hours), Villahermosa (2 hours), Merida (8 hours), Campeche (5 hours), Cancun (13 hours). One or two buses per day also ply from Mexico City (14 hours), Oaxaca (15 hours) and Tulum (11 hours). It is also possible to get to Palenque from Flores in Guatemala by bus (about 6 hours).\nThe entrance fee is M$45.\nSearch Copyright © 2011 MayanRuins.info All Rights Reserved.\nPrivacy Policy | Disclaimer | Contact>", "query_type": "subjective"}

Belfast's Titanic Quarter is a regeneration area on the original site of the Harland and Wolff shipyard - birthplace of RMS Titanic.Photograph by: Peter Macdiarmid\n, Getty ImagesNorthern Ireland is a place tinged with poignancy and mystery. A land of great beauty, it has seen its fair share of sorrows and strife. But like its people, it has a natural resilience and this year it is ready to celebrate some important anniversaries.It's been 100 years since the Titanic rolled off the slipways in Belfast and Northern Ireland's capital is commemorating the event with the Titanic Centenary Festival. This fusion of events throughout April includes plays, music, light shows and exhibits showcasing Belfast's most famous maritime export. The festival officially opens the new memorial garden by the existing Titanic sculpture on the east side of Belfast City Hall as well as Titanic Belfast. This six-storey, 14,000 sq. m (150,700 sq. ft) complex is located on the original Harland and Wolff shipyards where the RMS Titanic was built. The centre's majestic facade replicates four 27-metre-high hulls created with three thousand shaped panels of silver-anodized aluminum. Visitors take glass elevators to the bridge, where they travel through nine galleries of interactive exhibits recreating the tragic history of the ship, including its final hours. The Titanic exhibit is only one reason to visit this vibrant but compact city built between three rivers. Belfast has a rich legacy of Georgian, Victoria and Edwardian architecture reflecting its history as an industrial centre. Belfast City Hall was once an international Linen Exchange, and its Baroque Revival towers and lantern-crowned copper dome still dominate the skyline. Other beautiful Victorian buildings also draw tourists today after being converted into chic hotels, restaurants and bars.The city's rich heritage is reflected in its many churches. One of the most beautiful structures is St. Anne's Cathedral, also known as Belfast Cathedral, with its Hiberno-Romanesque facade and beautiful stained glass windows. Another is the twin-spired St. Peter's Cathedral, an imposing Victorian Gothic Revival building. The Belfast Festival has long been considered a cultural oasis in the city and it continues to play a part in Belfast's renaissance. Originally a small gathering on the campus of Queen's University, the festival quickly grew into a major cultural event showcasing Irish artists and musicians. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the festival, and from Oct. 19 to Nov. 3 it promises a wide selection of music, drama, theatre, talks, film, dance and comedy featuring an international roster of artists.Belfast is also a dynamic centre of European popular music where many genres of music thrive. The Belfast Music Exhibition at the Oh Yeah centre showcases much-loved Irish musicians who have provided the soundtrack to our lives. There is also the kitschy but fun Belfast Music Bus Tour for those who would like to follow in the footsteps of their favourite musicians. North of Belfast are the ravishing Glens of Antrim, known locally as simply The Glens. These nine valleys start at the Antrim Plateau and end at the Eastern coast. Famous for its breathtaking beauty, it's an area immortalized in hundreds of films and TV series. The first half of the Causeway Coastal Route to the small fishing village of Ballycastle in The Glens is dotted with castles and other historic buildings. Among the many sights there is the Norman Carrickfergus Castle, built in 1180; the Roman site where St Patrick was brought as a slave in 399; Glenarm Castle, the 400-year ancestral home to the McDonnell family; and the supposed haunted 17th-century Ballygally Castle. The small town of Ballycastle is the home to a traditional music festival in late June, the Fleadh Amhran agus Rince Festival, which gathers traditional musicians and dancers to perform Irish song and dance. This is the place to hear authentic Irish music. Nearby lies Rathlin Island, Ireland's closest point to Scotland. This small limestone and basalt island is speckled with standing stones, cairns, passage tombs, cashels, and ancient church and castle sites. It's been the site of many skirmishes between the Vikings, Scottish, English and Irish and is a natural stop for history buffs. Just beyond Rathlin lies the Giant's Causeway, a 60-million-year-old volcanic formation of 38,000 basalt columns. These hexagonal stones stretch out as far as the sea with some standing as tall as 12 metres. Popular legend has the giant Finn McCoy using these stones to create his homestead. In the summer of 2012, the National Trust opens the Giant's Causeway Visitor Centre, with interactive exhibits, guides, art galleries and restored trails. If you're up for it, take the 17-kilometre coastal path to the Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge. This 20-metre suspended bridge links the mainland to tiny Carrick Island. South of Belfast, the Mourne Mountains offer still more astonishing scenery. This is a popular destination for hikers and bicyclists who frequently travel along the Mourne Wall. Built between 1904 and 1922, this 35-km granite wall passes over 15 mountains. The view is said to have inspired C.S. Lewis to write his Narnia series. The Mourne Mountains region is also home to many picturesque villages. On the craggy coast of Carlingford Lough is the tiny village of Rostrevor. It lies at the foot of the Slieve Martin and has the Kilbroney River flowing through it. The village is known for its folk music, particularly the Fiddler's Green Festival. What started off as a small, one day-event has evolved into an internationally acclaimed festival for Irish music fans. This year's eight-day festival, July 22-29, is celebrating Fiddler's Green's 26th anniversary with 200 musical events in a free outdoor venue. The village makes a perfect base for those wishing to spend a few days exploring this area.IF YOU  more information, visit Tourism Ireland's website:  \" Previous 1 2 View as one page Next \"\nPostmedia Network Inc.Original source article: Beautiful, resilient Northern Ireland welcomes the world E-mail this ArticlePrint this ArticleShare this Article More on This Story Ireland's spiritual heritage is evident everywhereIreland has something for everyone Story Tools E-mail this ArticlePrint this Article Font:***** Image:****\nPreviousNext A road sign points the way to The Titanic Quarter in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

Filled with true-to-life meticulously hand-painted dinosaurs of all types, and the flora and fauna that added to the special tour, is the Prehistoric Forest in the Irish Hills in Cambridge, Michigan. Created in the '60s from a collaboration between two sculpture artists, these vintage works of art have been treated recently like a place for reckless destruction and disrespect for people's land and property.\nThe Prehistoric Forest in the Irish Hills in Cambridge, Michigan.\nThe people of the county of Cambridge respect and protect their curious Americana mascots in the forest, which opened in 1963, and featured 63 animatronic dinosaurs, and even a volcano that spewed out smoke. There was a water slide and a maze and a train that would take you through the park, and you could pose with the sculptures or ride a tram and \"shoot\" at the t-rex as you went by, which caused a shuddering roar in response. Since its closure in 1999, some of the features have been sold, but sadly, some of the dinosaurs have been purposefully destroyed. Apparently it had become somewhat of a tradition when a particular track meet came to town, and whether it was a symbolic gesture from a rival school or plain old ignorance, they ignored the \"no trespassing\" signs and went on to destroy some of the gentle giants with glee. Cambridge Township Police Chief Larry Wibbeler said the students were at Michigan International Speedway for a statewide cross country final, and after experiencing break-ins at the park for three years running, they were anticipating the meet as it is believed to be some sort of \"right of passage\" for neighboring schools.\nRecently the property had changed hands, and unbeknownst to the vandals, surveillance cameras  -  the kind that outdoors enthusiasts use to capture images of wildlife  -  were installed around the park. Photos showed that the trespassers included two males who were balding, which is how they realized this was not only children messing around, but children led to destroy by adults. It wasn't just a handful of kids either ... in all, thirteen high school students and two adults, ages 44 and 46, were ticketed with charges of vandalism and larceny following the Nov. 3, 2012 break-in. Those that pled guilty paid a $375 trespassing fine, but those that pled not guilty were to be in court by Jan. 17. The damages are still being assessed and the court will decide what, if any, restitution should be paid.\nIt is important to recognize this park as a work of art and our nation's history, but I would like to also recognize that these were not just bored kids with nothing to do. These were school leaders and athletes, and it's indicative of a bigger problem going on in society ... with our youth, parenting, and a lack of respect for people and property in general.\nThis was not just a deliberate pit stop from some of the star members of a track team, and students with high grade point averages and potential college scholarships, that ignored the laws, but honor roll students led by adults. Two fathers led these \"leaders of the next generation\" to break into a visibly marked and protected area that is a special part of Cambridge's history, and proceed to literally take the heads off of some of the sculptures.\nPerhaps not all of the kids were involved in the destruction, and perhaps you could even say they were swayed by peer pressure from the team stars to join in ... but every person has free will, and all of these kids were being led by adults they respected to break the law and destroy \"for fun.\"\nIt's said that when the police drove up to their town to deliver the relatively insignificant charges and tickets in relation to the amount of law breaking they did, one of the \"adults\" scolded them for using tax dollars on the gas.\nNow, on top of teaching them that breaking and entering and destruction of property is apparently an adrenaline filled joy-ride and a fun father- son weekend activity, this person is teaching them that rather than use your leadership potential to lead others to do the right thing, it's OK to abuse that power because you can probably get away with it. Not to mention absolving yourself of any responsibility by scolding the authorities for ticketing you.\nI'm flabbergasted that someone who could be a business owner or involved in education on any level  -  from attending track meets to teaching customer service skills to your staff  -  would even consider this behavior, much less carry it out with children in tow.\nHowever, let's just say he had a momentary lapse of reason and this wasn't premeditated (which it obviously had to have been.) You would think he'd be embarrassed and remorseful, making apologetic statements to the school district, land owner, the town of Cambridge, the students he led into law breaking and ultimately court, and the people that trust him to have respect for other people's property.\nWhat if this is the kind of person that is involved in the construction of your property or on the town board somehow ... would you trust them to build it with care? Would you trust them to care about your current property and not destroy anything on it? I would think it would give people considerable pause.\nCurrently, the owners of the dinosaurs and the land aren't sure what the future holds, but they do see a future that holds more sacred these great beasts and their place in our national guidebooks, and in the stunning state of Michigan's history. They see a future that is one of joy and respect and admiration, and they don't want people to look at the dinosaurs as their own personal conquest. They sincerely thank the people of Cambridge for their protection of and love for these giant old town mascots, and they hope that not only will that energy continue but will spread to neighboring towns that will also come to love and respect the one-of-a-kind work and history there. For now, they have heard that some of the property has been recovered and the full cost of damages is still being assessed. In the meantime, I hope that the parents of the kids that were involved read this article and really think about not only how they've acted, but how they've reacted.\nAnd given that these kids are expected to be representatives of their own schools and towns when they visit in a meet of any kind, they should at the very least have to perform some kind of community service, in addition to a fine, so that they understand that no matter how fast you run, you can't outrun responsibility.\nStaff Website Related Posts May 22, 2015 0 The first stop for military, camping and emergency utilities is The Supply Sergeant\nMay 15, 2015 0 Horizons at Calabasas is a unique senior community\nMay 7, 2015 0 'The 100 Year Journey' at Zorayan Museum April 13-24>", "query_type": "subjective"}

But three Taste Workshops held on Sunday October 28 at the Salone del Gusto and Terra Madre 2012 offered a new perspective on three of these countries' efforts to find a way out of the economic crisis, with a return to the countryside, a focus on typical, historic products and the promotion of tourism that goes beyond the usual sun, sand and sea clichés. Greece has been the most high-profile victim of the crisis, and its wine industry has been suffering. Antonios Kioseoglou, an enologist with the Kir-Yianni winery and a member of the Slow Food Thessalonika East convivium, speaking during the workshop \"Terra Madre Network: Wine and Cheese from Northern Greece,\" said that Greeks had effectively stopped buying wine. \"Sales are down 20, 30 percent,\" he said. While there had been a rise in exports, perhaps because of all the publicity surrounding the country, he said it hadn't been enough to make up for falling domestic sales. \"We're trying very hard to get wines out of Greece and let people know what's happening with Greek varieties.\"\nFor example, Xinomavro, a native grape variety, is incredibly versatile, able to produce sparkling white, sparkling rosé, still rosé, still red and sweet wines, examples of which were tasted during the workshop. \"If we go to Merlot and Shiraz,\" said Kioseoglou, \"we'll lose our identity and our heart and the things that make us different.\" He hopes that the wine industry can help boost tourism beyond the familiar Greek islands, with a well-developed network of wine routes in the inland areas. Like the Greek islands, Spain's Canary Islands, a few hundred kilometers off the northwest African coast, are primarily known for mass tourism, with 12 million visitors a year (the population of the archipelago is 2 million). The huge development of the tourism sector from the 1970s led to a change in the islands' economy, with the abandonment of fishing, agriculture and other traditional activities, which now make up just 5% of the GDP, explained Jorge Manuel Zerolo Hernández, an agronomist, winemaker and member of the Slow Food Tenerife Convivium, during the workshop \"Terra Madre Network: Wine and Cheese from the Canary Islands.\" He said that in the past few years, tourists have been arriving in the same numbers, but that they stay for a shorter time and spend less money. \"So we are trying to show the other side of the Canary Islands, combining tourism and agriculture,\" he said. Gabriel Morales Frances, a winemaker and the Tenerife convivium leader, said that the wines and cheeses being tasted during the workshop were \"an exemplification of the fact that the islands are not just sun and beaches.\"\nCarlo Catani, the former director of the University of Gastronomic Sciences, was leading the workshop. \"This crisis is reducing the number of jobs linked to tourism,\" he said, \"but it can also bring some people back to the fields, and their extraordinary work can make the tourism much richer. Then it is no longer just 10 minutes on the beach. The tourists can go inland, get to know the landscape and the history and have a better experience.\"\nThe Canary Islands have a rich history of traditional products to draw on, produced in the varied microclimates around the islands. Cheeses are made from the raw milk of native goat, sheep and cattle breeds, like Queso Palmero, made from Palmera goats on La Palma island, or a sheep's cheese curdled with vegetable rennet made from a type of cardoon specific to the islands, both of which were tasted during the workshop. Malvasia wines were among the first products to be exported from the Canaries, brought to the Americas by the Spanish conquistadors and mentioned by Shakespeare, John Locke and Kant, who used Canary wine as an example when exploring the concept of pleasurability. Different varieties of Malvasia grapes can be vinified to make a fresh, dry white or a complex, Solero-method sweet wine, able to age for decades. Like the Canaries, the Algarve in southern Portugal has long been associated with mass tourism: package holidays, golf resorts and beaches lined with high-rise hotels. But the arid region is also a rich treasure trove of traditional products, many of which were tasted during the workshop \"Terra Madre Network: Cheeses, Cured Meats and Wines from the Algarve.\" Sea salt, sweet potatoes, extra-virgin olive oil, blood sausage, chouriço, cured ham and goat's cheese were tasted, along with wines from native grapes and liqueurs flavored with almonds, honey and carob. Rosa Dias, from the Quinta da Fornalha organic farm, exemplifies the new trend towards sustainable agriculture, ecotourism and organic products that is helping revitalize Portugal's quintas, small-scale farms. Using carob, almonds and figs, the young farmer makes truffles, jams, spirits and chutneys, focusing on quality ingredients and added value as a way to compete with large-scale industry. \"Only old men were left in the countryside,\" said Otília Eusébio, the president of Slow Food Algarve. \"But now with the crisis, young people are returning. I think this crisis can be positive. Now for the first time young people are proud of tradition. They are leaving behind this disaster of globalization.\" Like the Canary Islands and Greece, the Algarve is also trying to move beyond the mass tourism model. \"We don't want the Algarve just to be this stressful, exploited tourism destination. We want it to become slow touristically.\" Now, she said, \"People are coming and discovering the genuine Algarve instead of the artificial Algarve.\"\nPhoto: The Telegraph>", "query_type": "subjective"}

Stately old homes kept boarders at the turn of the century. Charming bungalows housed families returning to normal life after World War II. Funky Doo Wop motels attracted enthusiastic thrill-seekers. And now, a boom in new construction tells of an era not yet known.\n(Note: The ads found on this page are from the original \"Five Mile beach Journal\" circa 1904. They appear here courtesy of the Wildwood Historical Society.)\nThe island's earliest visitors came for some of the same reasons summer tourists come today. They came to play, to swim, to fish, to eat well and to refresh themselves along its shore. But visitors to that Five Mile Beach would probably not recognize the land today.\nWildwood was once a wild place, inaccessible to all but a few Native Americans and hearty colonial pioneers. There were no roads to the remote island - no cars, no ferries, and no trains. Vast meadows of wetlands stood between the mainland and the treasures on the other side.\nMembers of the Ketchemeche Tribe, or Lenni Lenape, called the island \"five miles of health and happiness.\" These Native Americans had permanent settlements throughout Salem and Cape May Counties, but each summer, they gathered together on the island where the ocean cooled the air and the fish were plentiful.\nLater, colonial pioneers from the mainland brought a different type of visitor to the island for the summer season. These tourists came in droves...and on four legs. The island became a grazing ground for the county's cattle, horses and sheep. Resourceful farmers branded their animals and drove them across the wetlands at low tide or loaded them onto boats. The herds then roamed freely, feasting on the grasses, salt hay and vegetation that grew abundantly across the wild landscape.\nSome livestock were lost to wolves, but most thrived until autumn when they were driven back to the mainland. Occasionally, animals were lost or left behind, becoming as wild as the land they foraged.\nSome early visitors to the island did not come by choice. They were sailors brought crashing to the shore by rough Atlantic seas. In response to the frequent loss of life, the US government established a Life Saving Service in 1848. A station was erected near Hereford Inlet. It was manned by county residents and equipped with a watch tower and boats for spotting and rescuing sailors in distress.\nBetween 1873 and 1874, without the benefit of a paved road or a train, Hereford Inlet Lighthouse was built at the northern end of this remote land. An informal fishing village followed, as the Scandinavian fisherman who worked in the waters off the coast built modest shacks along the inlet. These were the island's first permanent residents.\nIn 1879 Frederick Swope, an entrepreneur with ties to the railroad, recognized the opportunity that existed along the shore. He purchased the title to Anglesea from Humphrey Cresse, and in 1882, formed the Anglesea Improvement Company. Development along Five Mile Beach had now begun.\nBy 1883 West Jersey Railroad was running from Cape May Court House to Anglesea. The train was unreliable, but it was a vast improvement over the wagons and boats that had brought the earliest visitors across the meadow. Local residents called the train the \"Mud Hen\" since the engine, whose tracks were laid across the wetlands, frequently found itself derailed at high tide. The passengers and crew would sit, stranded in the bog, until low tide when they shifted the tracks back into position, and continued on to Anglesea.\n\"Health and happiness\" continued to be a quest for the island's early settlers. Dr. William Tomkins, a retired army surgeon came to Anglesea in the hope of improving his health. He was the island's first postmaster, and in 1885 he was elected mayor by 24 voters in the burgeoning community. Unfortunately, the sea breezes failed to cure his illness and he died later that year. Peter Munro replaced him in his position as mayor.\nAnother pioneer's quest for a healthy environment led to development farther south along the island. In 1880 Aaron Andrew of Vineland brought his wife Sarah to Townsend's Inlet on the advice of her physician. When the fresh air and salt water seemed to improve her condition, he became interested in obtaining his own seaside residence.\nIn his search, he became acquainted with businessmen, Joseph Taylor and John Burk, and together they investigated the middle of Five Mile Beach. There they found an uninhabited forest surrounded by white sand beaches. Throughout the woods, holly trees grew in amazing shapes and sizes. In April of 1882, inspired by the wild landscape, the men formed the Holly Beach City Improvement Company.\nAs the streets of this new town were planned, some were named in honor of Cape May County's early pioneers: Hand, Cresse, Bennett and Leaming. Others were named for the shareholders of the new company: Joseph Taylor, John Burk, Nelson Roberts, John Davis, Thomas Montgomery, James Young, Harry Spencer and James McCandless. (McCandless Avenue was later changed to Morning Glory when Wildwood Crest was created.)\nOn the mainland, the Baker family of Lewisburg Pennsylvania had begun to make a name for themselves by developing land for commercial use in Vineland, NJ. When news of the Holly Beach Development project spread among their contacts in Vineland, Phillip and Latimer Baker saw investment opportunities on Five Mile Beach. Latimer obtained a position as director for the Holly Beach Company, and in 1883 Phillip visited his brother in Holly Beach to explore other parts of the island.\nThe brothers walked north through Holly Beach until they came to the town's border on Cedar Avenue. There they found a wild jungle of gnarled trees and tangled grape vines. Initially, Phillip found the land to be \"uninhabitable and inaccessible.\" An old Indian path had been cut through the woods near what is now New Jersey Avenue, but passage to the Anglesea was difficult. One early Holly Beach resident complained of the dangerous wild cattle that chased passersby into trees. The only other access north was along the beach at low tide.\nThe primitive landscape did not deter Phillip Baker from his course. He purchased a tract of 100 acres for $9,000.00, and established the Wild-wood Improvement Company. The borough of Wildwood was incorporated in 1895, and Latimer Baker became the town's first mayor. In 1898 when the original lots were cleared and sold, the brothers purchased ten more acres of the forest. Their property now extended all the way to Twenty-Sixth Street at the Anglesea town line. The great variety of trees that were cleared in the creation of Wildwood gave their names to the streets: Pine, Maple, Oak, Poplar and Magnolia.\nAccess to Holly Beach and Wildwood was still greatly restricted. At first visitors could only approach the middle of the island from Rio Grande Railway Station through an intricate series of log roads, sailboats and wooded paths. Later, some visitors chose to approach the island on the \"Mud Hen\" in Anglesea and travel south on foot.\nLimited transportation did not keep Five Mile Beach from developing at a feverish pace. Investors, moved by Phillip Baker's vision of the resort and inspired by his pioneer spirit, brought provisions and building material across the sound on flat bottom boats. Lots were sold and financed for payments of $10.00 a month, and grand beach cottages and boarding houses grew up like the trees they replaced. Wildwood and Holly Beach consolidated into the City of Wildwood in 1912.\nAs the island developed, great strides were made in transportation. Ferries began carrying passengers across the harbor from Rio Grande Avenue, and the railroad lines were improved. By 1903, passengers could change trains at Anglesea Station and travel south to Wildwood and Holly Beach Stations. A wooden bridge was erected in March of 1903 across the inlet at Rio Grande Avenue, and visitors now enjoyed unrestricted access to this once remote island.\nReal estate flyers at the time advertised the island's benefits to \"health and pleasure seekers,\" and while the benefits of the sea and salt air may have brought many of the original settlers to the island; it was the trees and parks for which the island was truly renowned. At one time, a wooded Park and fresh water lake covered the area that is now west of New Jersey Avenue between Wildwood and Oak Avenues. This park at Magnolia Lake was an early recreational center of the island.\nThe same twisted wild trees that had once made the land \"inaccessible,\" became popular tourist attractions. Locals gave them names inspired by their strange appearance: Elephant's Head, Grand Twist, and Columbus. The most famous tree however was the \"W\" tree, named so because the fierce off-shore winds had twisted it into the shape of an almost perfect \"W\". It was this tree that US President Benjamin Harrison insisted on being photographed with when he visited the Bakers in 1890. It was this wild tree that eventually appeared on Wildwood's official seal.\nAt the turn of the century, Phillip Baker turned his attention to the dunes and forests on the south side of the island, and by 1906 the first house was built in Wildwood Crest. The Bakers continued to draw new visitors and residents to the area. In 1910, New Jersey Governor Fort officially recognized the new borough of Wildwood Crest, and Philip Baker was elected mayor.\nPhillip Baker died in 1920. According to a promotional brochure developed by the Bakers and their associates, the assessed property value of Five Mile Beach from 1881 to 1910 jumped from $12,500 to $7,500,000. The once \"veritable forest by the sea,\" now offered \"sanitary drainage and sewers, pure artesian water... macadamized streets and cement sidewalks.\" Visitors could enjoy \"ocean piers, casinos, theatres, skating rinks, and other amusement enterprises.\" At Bakers death, the famous trees were not yet gone, and the island boasted, \"Very attractive groves and parks, with most substantial oak, cedar and holly trees.\"\nMany things have changed on Five Mile Beach, since the Lenni Lenapi vacationed on its shores. The vision of early pioneers and settlers created a vibrant and unique resort community from a remote and inaccessible island. The island continues to grow, and its cool ocean breezes and warm white sand still beckon to those in search of \"health and happiness.\"\nInformation compiled from the following : The Middle of the Island by George Boyer Cape May County, New Jersey: the Making of an American Resort By Jeffrey M.

Over the years, political and military upheavals, illicit excavation, pillaging of archaeological sites and landmines were destroying the site. Although many monuments are still in need of attention and pressure from tourism is growing, more than fifteen major conservation and restoration projects have been undertaken. In 2004, the Committee considered that Angkor was being properly managed and that the numerous conservation and restoration activities were successful and the site was removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger.\nSangay National Park (Ecuador)\nIn 2005, Sangay National Park, Ecuador, was removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger as significant measures had been taken to address threats. Heavy poaching of wildlife, illegal livestock grazing, encroachment along the park's perimeter and unplanned road construction were threatening to cause irreversible damage to the natural environment. Today, activities such as hunting, mountain climbing or illegal grazing can only be found in a minimal section of the park, and road construction has been modified to satisfy rigorous international environmental standards.\nIlulissat Icefjord (Greenland, Denmark)\nOver the years, the town of Ilulissat experienced a rise in the number of cruise tourists. Without proper management, the growing number of visitors led to difficulties such as attrition, crowding and problems of waste disposal. A management plan (2009-2014) was formulated with initiatives encompassing commercial hunting, motorized vehicles, navigation, recreational activities, research and information. When the plan was presented at a public meeting, many citizens joined the discussion about the management of the World Heritage site.\nIsland of Mozambique (Mozambique)\nDecades of wars and economic stagnation allowed the former historic capital, on the Island of Mozambique, to lapse into decay. Under a truly multi-donor rehabilitation project - with financing from Japan, Portugal, the Flemish Government of Belgium, the Netherlands and the Union of Luso-Afro-American-Asian Capital Cities - more than 100 local and Mozambican professionals and students were trained in traditional building techniques, using local building materials and decorative principles to restore the fortress and install a new public water cistern.\nTongariro National Park (New Zealand)\nNew Zealand's Tongariro National Park, whose mountains have cultural and religious significance for the Maori people and symbolize their spiritual links with the environment, was designated as the first cultural landscape on the World Heritage List in 1993. The recognition of cultural landscapes as World Heritage sites in 1992 was an important step in underlining the intimate spiritual relationship between peoples and their natural environment.\nOld Walled City of Shibam (Yemen)\nThe 16th-century Old Walled City of Shibam, Yemen, nicknamed 'the Manhattan of the desert', has been under threat of destruction because of the abandonment of the old agricultural flood management system in the wadi surrounding the city and the overloading of the traditional sanitary systems. Extensive conservation works implemented by partner organizations have resulted in the restoration of 65 per cent of the buildings, and large-scale flood control measures have been taken in the wadi.\nYellowstone National Park (USA)\nYellowstone National Park is the nucleus of the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA), which contains six National Forests, two National Parks, and two National Wildlife Refuges. In 1964, to coordinate management of the ecosystem across boundaries, the three federal land-management agencies that operate within the GYA formed the Greater Yellowstone Coordinating Committee (GYCC).A GYCC sub-committee launched, in 2007, a creative approach to developing an ecosystem-wide Climate Action Plan to identify and reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions: GHG emissions reduction projects were identified by each individual GYCC agency unit, aggregate into goals for each unit, and into ecosystem-wide GHG emissions goals. In this way, each unit not only has complete ownership over the emissions reduction actions in the plan, but also has control over its implementation timeline. The plan has evolved into a template for other environmentally sensitive areas in the country.\nMammoth Cave National Park (USA)\nAt 390 contiguous miles, Mammoth Cave is the longest cave in the world. Even though it was designated a national park in 1941 and inscribed as a World Heritage site in 1981, 80 miles of the cave and most of its 60,000 acre watershed lie outside the national park boundary. Thus, Park staff developed partnerships in many areas of park protection and management: groundwater, river resources, tourism, research and education. Partners include the Biosphere Reserve Council, made up of elected officials, conservation agents, and business people; the Kentucky Department of Transportation; the Nature Conservancy-Sustainable Rivers; Western Kentucky University; tourism businesses; local schools, and nature conservation volunteers.\nFujian Tulou (China)\nWith the goal of effectively protecting Tulou buildings, the local government has used developing the tourism industry as a critical opportunity for restructuring the local economy, and endeavors to build the county into a natural cultural tourist center and an excellent tourist destination rich in Hakka cultural characteristics. To fully encourage community participation in the protection and management of the heritage, the county government established such organizations as the County Tourism Development Office Villager Supervising Team and the Communist Party Member Volunteers. It also made efforts to enhance local villagers' awareness of protecting Tulou buildings, through bulletin boards, the distribution of information materials and occasional village meetings to view videos about protection.\nKaiping Dialou and Villages (China)\nInscription on the World Heritage List boosted the steady and sustainable development of Kaiping City's economy and social fabric. While protecting the heritage site in a scientific way and utilizing the historic buildings properly, the city promoted the development of tourism and related industry, thus providing numerous employment opportunities to the local residents. In addition, the city integrated various cultural resources to develop local tourism and related service industries. For example, local residents are employed to serve as administrators, guides and logistics personnel in scenic spots. They are also encouraged to run farm hotels, and to create Diaolou culture-related souvenirs so that the public can fully participate in the protection of the cultural heritage. The World Heritage status also led to dramatic improvement of local infrastructure.\nOld Town of Lijiang (China)\nInscription on the World Heritage List in 1997 has promoted cultural, economic and eco-environmental development of the city and the people living there. It provided the public with opportunities to better understand the Dongba culture as well as the ancient music and handicrafts of the Naxi ethnic minority. This, in turn, has encouraged protection and transmission of this culture. Over 2000 artists in the city have established opera troupes, traditional Chinese calligraphy and art galleries, and cultural product specialty shops. Moreover, the comprehensive development of tourism brought about by the World Heritage inscription has secured steady economic growth. While the city received a total of 845,000 visitors in 1995, the number reached more than 4 million in 2005; by then tourism directly or indirectly provided 116,000 job opportunities to citizens.\nCanadian Rocky Mountain Parks (Canada)\nIn 1907, when Jasper National Park was first established, there were several hundred indigenous people living in the park. Park legislation and management then did not consider indigenous perspectives and traditions, and alienated the aboriginal people. Striving to mend broken relationships, Parks Canada created the Jasper Aboriginal Forum in Jasper National Park in 2004. Biannual meetings of the Forum bring together Parks Canada and over 20 Aboriginal groups with a defined historic connection to the park. Over time, shared interests such as \"advancing the reconciliation process and facilitating access to the park\" were revealed. The most evident change that has resulted from the forum work lies in the new management plan for the park, which was tabled in Canada's Parliament in 2010. The new plan devotes a whole section to shared interests, incorporating for the first time such points as \"aboriginal voices ... influencing park planning and decision-making.\"\nSGang Gwaay (Canada)\nThe Haida people, native to the Gwaii Haanas (\"Islands of Beauty,\" also known as Queen Charlotte Islands), operate the Haida Gwaii Watchmen Program to safeguard their important cultural sites. The Watchmen, made up of men and women, elders and youth, spend shifts from two weeks up to the whole summer in Gwaii Haanas. They protect the sensitive cultural sites by presenting visitors with a first-hand introduction to Haida culture through sharing knowledge of the land and sea, and their stories, songs and dances. Having started with parties of one or two volunteers thirty years ago, today the Watchmen program is funded from several sources, including visitor fees. It has its own management and provides seasonal employment for the Haida.\nKluane / Wrangell-St Elias / Glacier Bay / Tatshenshini-Alsek (Canada/USA)\nThe goal of the \"Healing Broken Connections\" project is to build respectful relationships with the 'Kluane First Nation' and 'Champagne and Aishihik First Nations' peoples and help them reintegrate into Kluane National Park and Reserve. The site became the Kluane Game Sanctuary in 1943. At the time, Aboriginal people's entrance to the park for gaming and hunting purposes was no longer allowed. Launched in 2004, the four-year project took important steps in welcoming back the members of the First Nations into the area. This was through a series of activities, including youth and elder culture camps, historical presentations and traditional knowledge workshops for Aboriginal people and Parks Canada staff.\nThe Wadden Sea (Germany/Netherlands)\nSince 2010, sustainable and nature-sound tourism has been a focus at this site, and a joint German-Dutch project was launched to develop a sustainable tourism strategy for the entire World Heritage property. Meanwhile, the German National Parks introduced campaigns which proved to be successful. For instance, at the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park, more than 200 tourism and shipping companies work in close collaboration with the national park administration. They offer high-quality service and regional, seasonal, fair and environmentally compatible products. In the Wadden Sea National Park in Lower Saxony, travel by train to the coast is heavily advertised through the campaign \"Fahrtziel Natur (Destination Nature),\" in cooperation with the German railway company.\nPrimeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and the Ancient Beech Forests of Germany(Germany/Slovakia/Ukraine)\nThis World Heritage natural property preserves valuable beech forest and its ecosystem. A trilateral management project among Germany, Slovakia and Ukraine started in 2010, financed by a German advisory assistance programme. The project aims to enhance information exchange between protected areas in this serial, trans-boundary property. The network of experts and protected area management bodies cooperate in such fields as socio-economic aspects of buffer-zone management, and the development of joint information materials for better communication and awareness-raising. Sustainable use of natural resources in the buffer zones is a major component of the project. Considering it is essential to link to traditional practices and ethnic and cultural heritage in the region, the project supports traditional crafts, products and ecotourism, in order to strengthen sustainable resource use.\nWachau Cultural Landscape(Austria)\nA scenic hiking trail, called the \"World Heritage Trail,\" was planned from 2003 and finally integrated into the site in 2010. It is a circular, 180-km hiking route around the property, passing through all of the villages and cities of the World Heritage site. Thus it links all the main attractions of the region, such as monasteries, museums, old city centres, restaurants, wine estates and apricot farms with the unique traditional winegrowing landscape. The trail helps promote the sustainable development, notably in tourism, throughout the World Heritage property. Within a year of its introduction, the Trail has become a major draw of the site. In 2011, a special guide was issued by the site management office and the tourism marketing board, linking for the first time all of the special offers, guided tours and wine tavern opening days along the Trail.>", "query_type": "subjective"}

They achieved great advancement in many fields, including architecture, mathematics and astronomy. During 1519 to 1521, the Spanish Hernán Cortés conquered and colonized Mexico. Mexico was under the Spanish rule for nearly 300 years. In 1810, taking advantage of Napoleon's invasion of Spain, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, a Catholic Father, proclaimed Mexico's independence from Spain. His declaration, known as the \"Grito de Dolores\" in Mexico, started the struggle for independence which lasted eleven years. In 1821, the Treaty of Córdoba was signed at the conclusion of the Mexican War of Independence. A republic was proclaimed in 1822 and established in1824. After achieving independence, the political instability continued. In 1846, the Mexican- American War broke out. The war ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, forcing Mexico to cede almost half of its territory including Texas and California to the United States. During the four presidential term of Benito Juarez (from 1858 to 1872 including as interim president), the liberal reforms were promoted. And in 1861, France invaded Mexico and eventually defeated Mexican army. France installed the Habsburg Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian of Austria as Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico, who ruled as emperor from 1864 to 1867. President Benito Juárez kept the federal government functioning during the French intervention and restored the republic in 1867. Juárez returned to office and served as president until he died in 1872. Under the presidency of the authoritarian General Porfirio Diaz, the country achieved remarkable economic growth and political stability, however, at the same time, economic inequality and the political repression eventually led to the Mexican Revolution, which lasted from 1910 until 1920. During the Revolution, about 10 % of the country's population was lost. In 1917, The Political Constitution of the United Mexican States, which is the present constitution of Mexico, was drafted and approved. The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), formed in 1929 under the name of the National Revolutionary Party (PNR), held power for 71 years, winning every presidential election until 2000, when Vicente Fox Quesada of the National Action Party (PAN) won the race. The country's economy is strongly linked to the U.S. As to tourism, Mexico has one of the largest tourism industries in the world, according to the World Tourism Organization. It ranks fifth in the world and first in the Americas on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites with 31. On the second day, before the tour to Teotihuacan, we went to see the city sights of Mexico City first.\nWe started the city sightseeing with the 38m high Angel of Independence.\nNext visiting site was Zócalo where the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral and the National Palace were located.\nLegend has it that the Aztecs received a divine prophecy that they would prosper if they created a new city on the site where an eagle holding a snake in its mouth perched on a tree (or on a cactus, I forgot!) and that the Aztecs found the eagle in Zócalo. It is also said that the statue of the eagle was built at the exact point where there was the tree on which the eagle perched. They created the city reclaiming a lake, which has developed to be current Mexico City. They seemed very religious people. *DMC-ZS10/TZ20 records images in max.14-megapixel and DMC-ZS7/TZ10 in max.12-megapixel.\nA big monitor was being placed in Zócalo (Constitution Square). They were preparing for FIFA World Cup final to be held on the next day. The guide said the Mexican people favored Spain and that most of the Mexican would be glued to TVs on the day of the final. Was it true? Due to the preparation, the security was tightened and we could not enter the National Palace.\nWe also looked the Metropolitan Cathedral from outside. Many people gathered in the square. I saw a man burning incense spreading a sheet in a drizzle of rain. The guide told me that he was a shaman and preparing to break a hex. The guide said some Mexican people asked a shaman to cast a hex on a person they hated and that the hexed person asked a shaman to break it and that in some cases that person in turn asked to the shaman to cast back a hex. The Mexican people really seemed to be very religious. In a sense, it was amazing that such a custom was still alive there.\nThen we went to the shrine of the Virgin of Guadalupe. It was also a large and handsome shrine. I heard that it was the most visited catholic shrine because it was the only shrine in the Central and South America to be authorized by Vatican. The shrine keeps the famous image of the Virgin of Guadalupe. The image is said to be miraculously imprinted on the indigenous peasant's cloak. It is also said that the image has not faded away after hundreds of years since its first appearance on the cloak. The new building was constructed because the old shrine became tilted due to land sinking. You can see from my photo that the old shrine is tilted. The land continues to sink everywhere in Mexico City.\nAfter lunch, we headed to Teotihuacan.\nApproaching to Teotihuacan, the Pyramid of the Sun appeared out of the bus window. It was smaller than the Pyramid of Khufu in Egypt, but its appearance in nature was really spectacular. It seemed to me that it was more attractive to see the ancient relics in nature than in the busy cities as the pyramids in Egypt. After receiving a brief explanation about a room and an office of priest from the guide, we started touring Teotihuacan. We first climbed the Pyramid of the Moon. Though I only climbed 48 steps, I was out of breath at once because Teotihuacan was in high altitude. The view from the Pyramid of the Moon was familiar on TV and pictures. It is agreed that the ritual human sacrifice was practiced on the Pyramid of the Moon. I felt that it would be the best place to practice a ritual to offer their god a human sacrifice. The scenery would be beautiful if it was seen from the sky. The Pyramid of the Sun was seen on the back left.\nThen we went to the Pyramid of the Sun. There, the staircase continued to the top, allowing us to climb to the top. Since the Pyramid of the Sun was far higher and its staircase was steeper than that of the Pyramid of the Moon, I could not climb to the top without taking breath in the middle. And it was worth climbing. The view from the top was supreme! As we were told that our wish would be realized by receiving the energy from the Sun on the top of the Pyramid of the Sun, everyone seemed to try to charge its energy to him/her. I was really satisfied that I could visit here at the end of my world journey. Print>", "query_type": "subjective"}

The search for the physical remains of Fort Caroline, established by the French in 1564 and taken over by the Spanish just a couple of years later, has confounded researchers for generations. Aerial surveys and archaeological digs have done little to pinpoint its location.\nGuidance from helpful park visitors hasn't helped either.\n\"If we spent all our time chasing down every person's idea of where Fort Caroline is, we'd get nothing done,\" Morris says. \"It's one of Florida's great archaeological mysteries.\"\nDay Trips on the Spanish Heritage Trail:\nDatil Peppers: Florida's Hot Treasure\nMinorcan Culture Endures in St. Augustine\nThe De Soto Trail in Bradenton\nFort Myers Explorers, Old and New\nToday, the preserve is home to a replica of the fort, based on sketches of the 16th century structure and believed to be a one-third scale model of the original. It is surrounded by hiking trails and other noteworthy historical sites on the 46,000-acre preserve (12713 Fort Caroline Rd., Jacksonville, 904-641-7155, ).\nIn addition to the fort replica - which features interpretive exhibits that share the history of the explorers and freedom seekers who settled there - the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve includes the Theodore Roosevelt Area, with five different Florida ecosystems visible in one hike; the Fort George Island Visitor Center, which describes the natural and cultural history of the preserve's island home; and Kingsley Plantation, which includes the oldest standing plantation house in Florida as well as several original slave cabins.\nYet the highlight remains the fort commonly thought of as Jacksonville's \"Atlantis.\" The search has been stymied partly because the fort's originators didn't want to be found.\n\"Back in that time period, the cartographers that were making maps weren't necessarily honest about where they were placing their fort,\" says John Whitehurst, the staff archaeologist and historian at the Timucuan preserve. \"The maps were of a new land mass, and everybody was trying to establish some kind of dominance. You didn't want to give your enemies an exact location for where you were landing.\"\nThe French first arrived at the mouth of the St. Johns River in 1562, when Jean Ribault led an exploratory expedition to the region. France was initially interested in the Americas to keep up with Spain, the world superpower of the day. But French colonization efforts became more intense with growing persecution of French Protestants, or Huguenots, and their most powerful member - Admiral Gaspard de Coligny - proposed establishing an American colony as a refuge.\n\"I'm passionate about the story of these freedom-seeking people who came here to Fort Caroline,\" Morris says. \"They were the first people to cross the ocean to the new world with the goal of seeking something you can't touch: freedom of religion and self-government.\"\nRibault returned to the region in 1565 with reinforcement supplies for the fort. But when the Spanish learned Ribault was returning to northeast Florida, Philip II of Spain dispatched Admiral Pedro Menendez to set up a post at what the Spanish called San Agustin, or modern-day St. Augustine.\nRibault sailed to attack the Spanish, but a hurricane wreaked havoc on his mission, and Menendez marched to Fort Caroline through the storm to take it over.\n\"The hurricane changed history, quite literally,\" Morris says.\nTo round out a visit to Timucuan preserve, try these stops:\nBig Talbot Island State Park\nIn this state park (13802 Pumpkin Hill Rd., Jacksonville, 904-696-5980, ), the skeletal remains of live oak and cedar trees rise from the beach, creating a majestic and unusual scene at a spot called Boneyard Beach. The effects of weather and erosion have created this effect, turning trees that once grew near the ocean into curiosities for beachophiles on the lookout for a new view.\nBoaters can launch from the island's north side to cruise the salt marsh. Nature lovers can also drop a kayak in the water, available for rent through Kayak Amelia, 888-30-KAYAK (305-2925).\nAfter a day spent exploring natural Florida, head to nearby Fernandina Beach, another northeast Florida locale with a history influenced by the French, British and Spanish colonizers.\nThe city, named after King Ferdinand VII of Spain, is located on an island the Spanish called Isla de Santa Maria, though the British name is the one that stuck: Amelia Island.\nFernandina Beach, known for its striking late 19th century architecture and bustling historic business district, came into its own during the railroad boom years.\nToday, the old waterfront train depot - originally the eastern end of Florida's first cross-state railroad - is home to the Amelia Island Tourist Development Council (102 Centre St., 904-277-0717, ameliaisland.com). A stop at the depot for a walking tour map of Fernandina Beach is a good place to start a downtown visit.\nThe city's main street, Centre Street, is lined with thriving boutiques, restaurants and bookstores. And don't forget the charming numbered side streets, such as South Third Street, where you'll find eateries such as Kelley's Courtyard Cafe (19 S. Third St., Fernandina Beach, 904-432-8213, kelleyscourtyardcafe.com).

Telephone: 01573 460365. The tower is open all year (weekends only in winter). Access is restricted for those with mobility problems. Tickets are £3.70 for adults, £3 for concessions and £1.85 for children.\nIt dates from the 15th century and was built by the Pringle family who were close supporters of the Black Douglases. The family suffered terribly at Flodden in 1513 when David Pringle, the laird, lost his elder son and three brothers fighting the English. In the 1540s matters got worse when the tower and surrounding area were raided by English reivers and their Scottish allies. Insolvency forced the sale of the tower after the death of Sir James Pringle in 1635 when it was bought by Sir William Scott of Harden. The castle houses an exhibition of figures and tapestries reflecting the intimate link between Sir Walter Scott, his Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border and his early childhood at nearby Sandyknowe Farm. Scott stayed at his grandfather's farm as a \"wee, sick laddie\" in 1773 and his grandmother and aunt, Janet Scott, told him tales of the Borders countryside. Scott later said that the sight of the tower \"standing stark and upright like a warden\" was a powerful inspiration. In the 1790s Scott and his friend Robert Shortreed spent a great deal of time in the area collecting tales from countryfolk which formed much of his minstrelsy which was published in 1802. Historic Scotland is delighted to be supporting the 2009 Year of Homecoming with a series of initiatives including family trails, spectacular events and the creation of a Homecoming Pass for heritage attractions in association with other heritage organisations.

The very mention of its name conjures up images of cascading waterfalls, pristine beaches, rolling green hills and majestic mountains.\nWhile the island is well known for its natural beauty, rich culture and vibrant creative industries, it is also widely regarded as the world's business gateway to the Caribbean. The largest English-speaking island in the region and the third largest overall, Jamaica is an excellent location for investment and trading with the rest of the Western Hemisphere and beyond.\nWith a population of 2.7 million, the country offers a literate, well-trained, multi-skilled and competitively priced labour force. It boasts an open and diverse economy with encouraging prospects in several industries and a strong international profile built on quality and bold creative energy.\nJamaica's land area is 10,991 sq. km (4,244 sq. miles), measuring 235 km (146 miles) from west to east and 82 km (50 miles) from north to south at its widest point. The highest point on the island is the Blue Mountain Peak, which rises to 2,256 m (7,402 feet). Jamaica is 145 km (90 miles) south of Cuba and 885 km (550 miles) south of Miami, Florida. The island is characterized by a mountainous interior and beautiful white sand beaches located on the north and west coasts.\nKingston, the capital city, is situated on the southern end of the island and is the country's major commercial centre. It is home to the world's seventh largest natural harbour - the Kingston Harbour. In the parish of St. James lies the resort town of Montego Bay, Jamaica's second city and the tourism mecca of the Caribbean.\nJamaica has an inviting tropical climate, with the annual temperature falling between 24ºC or 75ºF to a maximum of 32ºC or 90ºF. Cooler temperatures are experienced in the mountainous areas and rainfall is seasonal.\nEnglish is the official language. However, most Jamaicans speak Jamaican creole or patois in everyday conversational language.\nThe vast majority of Jamaicans are Christians. However, other religions exist in Jamaica such as Judaism, Islam, Hinduism and Rastafarianism. Political Climate\nJamaica has an established tradition of democracy, with the Government being voted into power by constitutionally free elections. Parochial elections are held every three years, while national elections are held every five years. The system of government and the constitution of the country are based on the Westminster Parliamentary model. The judiciary exists as an independent arm of the government and there are constitutional provisions to protect the rights of citizens.\nJamaica operates as a mixed free-market economy with both state and private sector participation in productive enterprise. The economy recorded GDP of US$13.7 billion in 2010 with the main sectors of the economy being Tourism, Agriculture and Agro-processing, Mining, Manufacturing, Creative Industries and Financial Services.\nThe economy is driven by foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign exchange earned through exports and remittances. Jamaica received an estimated US$201 million in FDIs in 2010. The most dynamic sectors in term of foreign direct investment (FDI) have been tourism, ICT and mining. The Jamaican Diaspora also contributes significantly to the economy through remittances, which amounted to over US$1.7 billion in 2009. Jamaica also boasts a developed tourism industry and continues to enjoy record levels of tourist arrivals. For the January to March 2011 period, tourist arrivals increased 4.4% with 553,304 compared to 529,934 in the corresponding period in 2010. This follows increases of 4% and 6% in both tourism arrivals and revenues in 2010. Jamaican exporters are able to access several key markets through preferential trade agreements and other multilateral trade agreements. In 2010, merchandise exports earned US$1328 million. The export value of non-traditional goods specifically food and beverages and tobacco have also increased due to the marketing and recognition of Brand Jamaica.\nThe official currency is the Jamaican Dollar (JMD), but most financial institutions accept other major currencies.>", "query_type": "subjective"}

American Indians, Europeans, African Americans, and Americans have each found opportunities to establish themselves and prosper in the Natchez area of Mississippi along the great river. Natchez National Historical Park preserves historic sites that reveal stories of the diverse peoples who settled in the historic riverbank town of Natchez, the oldest permanent European settlement along the Mississippi River. From the site of the French Fort Rosalie to the antebellum Melrose estate and the home of an African American barber and diarist, Natchez National Historical Park allows visitors to experience the rich history and diversity of Natchez.\nThe human history of the area extends back thousands of years before the European settlement of Natchez began in 1716 with a French trading post. By the time Europeans first passed through this area in the late 16th century, the Natchez Indians and their ancestors before them had been living and thriving there for quite some time. The early ancestors of the Natchez Indians were primarily hunters and gatherers who lived off the waters, land, and forests of southwestern Mississippi. By the 9th century, improved agricultural methods for cultivating maize, beans, and squash, and the introduction of the bow and arrow allowed the Natchez Indians to settle into a more sedentary lifestyle and become part of the mound-building cultures.\nFrom 800 A.D. until 1400 A.D., the Natchez constructed mounds, as did other American Indian groups along the Mississippi River and elsewhere in the Southeastern United States. The Natchez built earthworks and mounds that served as ceremonial centers, urban centers, and the sites of civic life and games. These construction projects required great planning providing evidence that the Natchez had a well-organized society. They participated in extensive trade networks that circulated goods from the Gulf of Mexico all the way to the Great Lakes area. By the time the Spanish explorer Hernando De Soto passed through the Natchez region in the 1540s, the mound-building cultures were in decline.\nWhen the French began to settle in the Natchez area, the Natchez Indians welcomed the newcomers, and relations between the two groups were relatively civil. In 1716, two years before the founding of New Orleans, the French established Fort Rosalie as the center of control for France's colonization of the lower Mississippi River Valley. By 1729, relations between the French and the Natchez had deteriorated, and the Natchez attacked and killed most of the inhabitants at Fort Rosalie. The French retaliated by sending in reinforcements, and by 1731, most of the Natchez Indians had either fled the area, or had been killed or adopted into other tribes such as the Chickasaw, the Cherokee, or the Creek. Melrose Estate\nCourtesy of Mac Katz, Flickr's Creative Commons\nFollowing the French, the British and Spanish in turn occupied the Natchez area until the end of the 18th century when the United States gained control. Natchez's prime location along the Mississippi River provided convenient river access for travel and trade and fertile soil for cultivation. These combined factors helped make Natchez a major center for the South's cotton empire and cotton plantations by the 1820s. By the 1830s, the wealth and culture from the southern cotton plantations had made Natchez a cosmopolitan town. The town had theaters, banks, and printing offices, and the wealthy planting elite lived in large mansions in and around the outskirts of town. Natchez became a place where the wealthy white planter elite lived among enslaved African Americans; free \"people of color;\" immigrants from Ireland, Germany, France, and Italy; and middle class shop-owners and tradesmen. Two men living in Natchez in the 1800s, John T. McMurran, a wealthy lawyer, entrepreneur, and plantation owner; and William Johnson, a freed slave, business owner, barber, and slave-owner, exemplify the entrepreneurial theme that has long been a part of Natchez history. John T. McMurran found success and prosperity in Natchez shortly after he arrived from Pennsylvania in 1825. He quickly established a successful law practice, won election to the State legislature, married into a successful local family, and acquired the first of five plantations. In 1841, McMurran purchased 133 acres of land just outside of Natchez to construct his luxurious home, Melrose. He built his Greek Revival style mansion over the course of eight years using free and enslaved labor. Melrose exemplifies the lifestyle of the wealthy at the height of Southern prosperity during the \"Cotton Kingdom\" years. Melrose's two story colonnaded porches, four massive Doric columns, parlors, and hidden hallways (through which enslaved African Americans used to move discreetly about the house) provide visitors with a glimpse into the lifestyle of the pre-Civil War American South. Visitors can take a guided tour of Melrose. With its handsome house, many original furnishings, outbuildings, and landscape design, Melrose is one of the best-preserved antebellum estates in Natchez. William Johnson House Courtesy of the National Park Service\nAlso a part of Natchez National Historical Park, the William Johnson House in downtown Natchez is only a short distance from Melrose. Like McMurran, William Johnson made the most of his entrepreneurial skills and surroundings. Born as an enslaved African American, Johnson obtained his freedom at the age of 11. He later became a very successful barber, property owner, and entrepreneur in Natchez--an example of the American rags to riches story. Like many of the wealthy white planters of this era, Johnson was also an avid diarist. Contained in 14 leather bound volumes and spanning from 1835 to 1851, his diary entries tell the story of everyday life in antebellum Natchez, his own business dealings, his experiences as a slave owner, and his desire for success. Johnson did succeed, and eventually owned several barbershops around Natchez. He also loaned small sums of money at interest to white businessmen and operated a \"buy & sell\" business and a small scale hauling operation. In 1840, Johnson began construction on his mother-in-law's State Street property of a new three-story home for himself and his family. He used bricks from Natchez buildings that were destroyed in the infamous tornado of 1840 to build what would be his final home. In 1841, Johnson moved his family into the second and third levels of the home and rented out the ground level space to merchants. Over the next decade, Johnson had great success in his businesses and in his growing family; unfortunately, his life came to a sudden end with his murder over a boundary dispute in 1851. His large family continued to live in the house long after his death. Today, visitors can take free self-guided tours of the house to see the Johnson family's living quarters and many of their original furnishings, and learn more about the lives of free African Americans in the pre-Civil War South.

Photos courtesy Rabbi Ezra Amichai\nThe heroes of Chanukah are no secret. The legendary Judah Maccabee and his warrior brothers defeated the Greek Hellenists in true Israelite fashion. Just as a young David slew Goliath, this tiny family-led army defeated a powerful military force. That much we know. But where in the world do we find a physical trace of these ancient warriors? The mystery of the elusive trail of the Maccabim, as they are known in Hebrew, begins between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Near the entrance to Modi'in, one of Israel's fastest-growing cities, elaborate Hasmonean graves are clearly marked with modern signage. Local legend suggests this is indeed the site of the ancient city of Modi'in, Maccabee headquarters during the time the Chanukah story took place. But is this, in fact, where the clan was laid to final rest 22 centuries ago? Our search begins with the establishment of the modern city of Modi'in, which launched construction only in the 1990s. Next door, Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach founded the collective settlement of Moshav Mevo Modi'im with a similar-sounding name more than 35 years ago. Developers unearthed thousands of relics after digging into two Modi'im sites. The first was Titora Hill, where archeologists discovered fascinating signs of ancient habitation, including remains of a large settlement. An elaborate tunnel system dating from the Bar Kokhba period and a crusader fortress also were unearthed. Today, the ruins stand as a green sanctuary in the middle of a burgeoning city. The second major find came to light on the nearby road running from Modi'in to Latrun (between Shilat Junction and Mevo Modi'im), at the site called Um el-Umdan, Arabic for \"mother of pillars.\" During the construction of Route 2, excavations unveiled the oldest synagogue in all of Israel, decorated externally with pillars, which led to the locale's moniker. Inside, archaeologists discovered beautiful frescoes. Other remarkable evidence includes a 25-room villa from the Hasmonean era and a Second Temple-era mikveh. In the second century C.E., following the Bar Kokhba revolt, the Romans razed this Jewish village. The amazing discoveries at these sites derailed construction in the area and proponents proposed both as locations of the ancient village of Modi'in. But across the street from the aforementioned Um el-Umdan is perhaps the most remarkable discovery of all. On Highway 443, between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, bilingual Hebrew and English signs point to \"Maccabean Graves  -  Hashmonean Village.\" Here, in a story that rings familiar for many sites in Israel, a group of Jewish schoolchildren and their Zionist teacher were seeking a connection with these strong Jewish heroes in 1907. They asked a local Arab shepherd if he knew where the Maccabim were buried. He led them to a site called Kubur al-Yahud, Arabic for \"the graves of the Jews.\" On Erev Chanukah, they lit the first candle of the holiday and danced at the cluster of monumental graves. This Chanukah tradition continues today. Experts doubt this is the authentic site of the Maccabee graves, but popular belief endures. A look at the ancient texts describing the events of Chanukah offers more hints of the real location. As it states in the Book of Maccabees I (13:25-30), Shimon, the sole survivor, buried his family. He also constructed a pyramid-like tombstone on each of the graves for his parents and four brothers as well as his own future final resting place. Advertisement\n\"Shimon sent for the bones of his brother, Jonathan, and buried them in Modi'in, city of his forefathers.\n\"All of Israel eulogized him and mourned for him many days.\n\"Shimon erected over the tombs of his father and brothers a monument of stones, polished front and back, high enough to be seen from a distance. \"He set up seven pyramids facing one another for his father and his mother and his four brothers. \"For the pyramids he devised a setting of big columns, on which he carved suits of armor as a perpetual memorial, and next to the armor he placed carved ships, which could be seen by all who sailed the sea. \"This tomb which he built at Modi'in is there to the present day.\" It's impossible to conclude the accuracy of the enduring folk legend around the location of the graves. But excavations dating from the 19th century suggest the traditional site misses the mark and that Midya, a nearby Arab village, more closely fits the ancient description instead. Meanwhile, the experts qualified to actually determine the veracity of the myth are archaeologists, who remain unwilling to excavate the graves due to the sensitivity of the religious community. With the popular fervor for strong Jewish heroes so attached to the current site, the mystery of the Maccabee graves is likely to endure. For those interested in exploring more of Hasmonean lore, the beautiful botanical garden and biblical nature reserve at Neot Kedumim offer insight into daily Hasmonean life. Activities include crushing olives for oil with a massive stone mill, creating clay lamps, drawing water, milling flour and participating in biblical cooking classes. Another wonderful excursion through time is available both above and underground at the Jerusalem Archaeological Park and Davidson Center, where Maccabee-era houses, ritual baths, and galleries and multimedia presentations buttress the southern entrance to the Old City and Kotel area. Virtual panoramas, time lines and more are found on the park's Web site.

Between these heights, on a saddle-shaped ridge connecting the\nMarina Grande, (\"Large Marina\") - north end - and the Marina Piccola,\n(\"Small Marina\") to the south - is the town of Capri (138 m.). The other town,\nAnacapri (286 m.), sits in the large, verdant plain to the west of Mount Solaro.\nCapri contains a vast variety of plants and flowers, offering no fewer than 850\nspecies and 130 varieties, despite its extremely small surface area, including some\nrarities, such as the dwarf palm, which has survived in a number of inaccessible areas. In\nterms of wildlife, many species of marine animals enrich the surrounding sea. On land,\nthere are many types of non-migratory birds, such as the large diomedei gulls, and there\nare also reptiles, whose number includes the very rare lizard of the Faraglioni rocks.\nThe etymology of the name Capri must be traced back to the Greeks, the first colonists to\npopulate the island in recorded time. This means that \"Capri\" was not derived\nfrom the Latin \"Capreae\" (goats), but rather the Greek \"Kapros\" (wild\nboar).\nThe numerous fossil remains of that animal found on Capri confirm that it was\nonce the Island of the Wild Boars, and not the island of the Goats, as the Latin\nderivation would seem to indicate. Inhabited since the paleolithic age, when it was still\nattached to the mainland, the island later became Greek, and then Roman. After visiting\nCapri in 29 BC, Caesar Augustus was so taken with the islandls beauty that he bought it\nfrom the city of Naples, giving up the nearby island of Ischia - much larger - in return.\nLegend has it that his successor, Tiberius, who lived there from 27 to 37 AD, built twelve\nvillas, dedicating them to the twelve gods of Olympus.\nFrom the most magnificent of these dwellings, the \"Villa Jovis\", he ruled the\nRoman Empire. Other emperors spent time in Capri, which was visited and inhabited by Roman\nnobles up through the IVth century AD.\nReturned to the ownership of the Dutchy of Naples, the island was raided by the Saracens\nin the sixth and seventh centuries, and was dominated during various periods in the years\nthat followed by the Longobards, the Normans, the Angevins, the Aragonese and, finally,\nthe Spanish.\nThe island experienced a period of renewed good fortune in the 17th and 18th\ncenturies, in coincidence with the great political and artistic upsurgence of Naples, and\nthanks to the existence of an active church diocese, as well as the privileges granted the\nisland, first by the Spanish and then by the Bourbons. Evidence of this golden period is\nthe stupendous architecture of the churches and convents built in the two towns.\nBeginning in the second half of the 18th century, the island became a preferred\ndestination of the Bourbons, who went there to hunt quayle and simply to travel. Many of\nthe increasing number of visitors from the north who came to take in the magnificently\nprimitive nature of the south included the island in their travel plans and gave the world\nits first images of Capri.\nUnfortunately, their arrival also brought about the systematic plundering of the extensive\nRoman ruins, preserved almost intact throughout the centuries. As a result, a tremendously\nrich heritage was devastated and dispersed, so that today only a few traces remain. These\nare found primarily in the digs that are resumed at periodic intervals.\nStarting in the first half of the last century, in the wake of the discovery of The Blue\nGrotto, or \"Blue Cave\", the flow of Italian and foreign tourists began, being\ndrawn to the island by the climate, the hospitality of the people and the colors and\nmagnetic atmosphere of the various sites. Writers,\npainters, exiles, rich and eccentric visitors: from the end of the 1800's until the Second\nWorld War, many chose the island as their year-round or seasonal residence, building\nvillas and contributing to the creation of the multi-facetted, multi-lingual, cosmopolitan\ncolony that made the name Capri famous and established the island's myth.\nVia Krupp\nIn 1900 the German magnate Krupp financed a street for travel by foot that joined\nthe Quisisana, where he lived, to the Marina Piccola.\nBuilt with admirable skill by the engineer Emilio Mayer, it has been called \"the\nworld's most beautiful road\", thanks to the manner in which it hugs the rock and the\nappropriate use of local construction materials .\nThe Gardens of Augustus\nThese belonged to the villa of Friedrich Alfred Krupp, son of the founder of the\ngreat German steelworks, who took up residence in Capri towards the end of the last\nBuilt on the ruins of ancient Roman structures, the gardens were donated by Krupp to the\nTown of Capri, which later named them for the Roman emperor. In a corner of the garden, a\nstatue of Lenin by the sculptor Manzu was erected to commemorate his stay on the island.\nVilla San Michele - Axel Munthe\nThe villa was built for the Swedish physician and writer Axel Munthe,\nauthor of the well-known novel The Story of San Michele\". The construction involved\ntransforming a simple country home and an old chapel dedicated to San Michele and\noriginally built on exquisitely decorated ruins from the Augustan age that demonstrate the\npresence on that spot of a sumptuous residence.\nThe style of the imposing structure is very free, set in the middle of a large, well\ncared-for park. It is owned by the Swedish Munthe Foundation and is open to the public:\nmany of the founder's possessions, including rustic and antique furniture, as well as\ncountless archaeological artefacts, are preserved in a charming atmosphere.\nVilla Jovis\nThe island's largest imperial villa, it was built for Tiberius at the\nbeginning of the Ist century AD and discovered in the 1700's under the Bourbon ruler\nCharles.\nThe first exploration took place in 1827; the dig was expanded in 1932-35 by A. Maiuri who\nbrought to light much of the original structure, which covers 7,000 sq. meters; the\ngardens of the villa must have originally covered the entire hill.\nThe structure, built to an uncommon height, consisted of a number of different floors\nterraced along the natural slope of the land, with the difference from the highest to the\nlowest point being 40 m.\nExcursion to Capri\nCapri, hotels, restaurants and shopping\nWhat to see in Capri - Places to visit\nGetting here - Ferry schedule\nCapri Map\nHotel Onda Verde to Favorites Send\nto a Friend!

July 14, 1789, is a French national holiday that celebrates the invasion by Parisians of the fortress-prison Bastille Saint-Antoine, killing many soldiers. Historically, the Bastille not only held common criminals and religious dissenters, but also political prisoners who displeased the monarchy - though in July 1789, the inmates numbered only 7. More to the point, the Bastille housed large quantities of arms and gunpowder needed by the Parisians for their insurrection. Ultimately, the Bastille represented a symbol of absolutism. This monumental day was the most dramatic of the early events of the French Revolution, though the more lasting achievement is no doubt the adoption of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, in late August of that year.\nJean-Pierre Houel, Prise de la Bastille, 1789. Watercolor. Bibliothèque nationale de France\nAs an aside, among the better-known inmates of the Bastille is Pierre François de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal, the last Governor-General of New France, imprisoned briefly in 1762 for his role in the loss of the French colony. Vaudreuil-Cavagnal, the first Governor-General to be born in Canada, was considered by others in the colonial administration of Louis XVI to be \"too Canadian.\" Vaudreuil-Cavagnal is recognized today for having maintained excellent relations with the First Nations allied with France. For insight into the complex diplomatic history of that time, read the account by historians Ruth B. Phillips and Michael Witgen (Ojibwe) of the Anishinaabe outfit assembled by the British officer Andrew Foster in the online version of the exhibition Infinity of Nations, or see the outfit on view at the Heye Center in New York.\nAnishinaabe outfit collected by Andrew Foster, ca. 1790. Fort Michilimackinac, Michigan. Birchbark, cotton, linen, wool, feathers, silk, silver brooches, porcupine quills, horsehair, hide, sinew. 24/2000 et al.\nHow do the French celebrate such a colossal day in history? They party! I asked a few friends from Paris what they do on July 14. First of all, most people do not have to work that day, leaving the day open to watch the military marches on the Champs-Elysées. Many Parisians will gather with friends and family for lunch and dinner, complemented by pastries and followed with wine and champagne at the Eiffel Tower during the fireworks. Others will attend a party held on the Place de la Bastille. One of the most popular activities includes parties at firehouses where music and drinks ensure a good time.\nHere at the NMAI, we celebrate Bastille Day by walking through the Saint-Lauren exhibit in Our Lives, on the museum's third level. Saint-Lauren is composed of a proud Métis community that celebrates Métis Day with jigging and fiddling all night long! The Métis of Saint-Lauren have a traditional language called Mischif, composed of Ojibway, Saulteaux, Cree, and Canadian French. In the past, Métis children were discouraged by teachers to speak their language, rather they were told to \"speak proper French.\" Nevertheless, today the Métis raise their blue and white flag proudly to celebrate their French and First Nations heritage.\nClaude Monet, Rue Montorgueil, Paris, Festival of June 30, 1878, 1878. Oil on canvas. Musée d'Orsay, Paris, France\nBastille Day waiter's race in Washington, D.C.\nFor those of us in Washington, D.C., let's see if there are ways that we can celebrate Bastille Day! Interestingly enough, there are several fun festivities happening July 14 through the 17. Today at noon, there is a French maid race on Pennsylvania Avenue, featuring waiters and waitresses dressed up in maid costumes; the challenge is to run while carrying a tray holding a glass of champagne. Another French maid race will take place in the evening at 8 PM at the L'Enfant Café on 18th Street NW. The Café will host a Masquerade Ball Bastille fête starting at 4 PM, continuing through the night. For the better connected, the French Embassy will host a gala cocktail soirée in honor of Bastille Day on Saturday, July 16.

It is part of the quality of life that enriches Vermonters and attracts guests.\nSustainable recreation is a use of our natural resources that does not diminish the quality or diversity of our environment. We believe we are managing state lands in a sustainable manner, so future generations will be able to enjoy the lands we have sought to protect permanently.\nThe State of Vermont in 1999 celebrated the 75th anniversary of its State Parks. Although much changed during the parks' first 75 years, Vermont State Parks are recognized as great places to recreate for a weekend, a week, or a lifetime. The State Parks need updating, however, to serve us in the next century.\nVermonters and guests often seek a more active form of recreation than they did in 1924 or 1964. A relaxing camp with a cool evening and a great view is still in high demand, as is a pristine stream with native brookies, and the calendars of thousands of Vermonters take note of deer season; but many more hikers, golfers, bikers, paddlers, marathoners, and climbers are looking for experiences that may take them to a state campsite, to a softer night's sleep at a bed and breakfast, or to a remote wilderness camp. The nation's aging population may also be driving marketplace demand for more four-season resorts and second homes.\nThe state has acquired significant, high-quality land throughout the state. It is working closely with other public and private entities to develop thoughtful long-term, comprehensive management plans for these resources. Doing this well in the next five years is a major priority and challenge for the Agency and all concerned.\nAlthough the Agency of Natural Resources is mandated to serve as the principal steward of Vermont's natural resources, many businesses and non-profit organizations, as well as the thousands of everyday decisions by Vermonters and visitors about where and how they can recreate, have a tremendous impact on outdoor recreation in Vermont. Ski areas are developing into four-season resorts, extending their snowmaking capacity and creating slopeside communities. People recreating in the outdoors can have a decisive effect on species, such as the common loon, and can spread non-native aquatic species which may have the potential to decimate water bodies and native species. Heavy use of trails and small lakes can change the nature of the experience, generate hazards, and create the need to manage competing uses.\nVermont as a place to play and rejuvenate...\nThe Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation operates more than 50 State Parks. Some parks are highly developed, while others offer a quieter, more remote outdoor experience -- reflecting the variety of recreation Vermonters want today. State parks are now more than places to go camping, picnicking, boating, and swimming. They are protection areas for critical natural resources while also accommodating compatible forms of recreation.\nGreen River Reservoir State Park, opened in 1999, is an outstanding example of how the Department seeks to mix recreation and wildlife habitat protection. The 5,153-acre park has the longest stretch of undeveloped shoreline in the state and is the largest body of water dedicated solely to non-motorized recreation. The park is also home for moose, white-tailed deer, black bears, bobcats, river otters, mink, coyotes, loons, and osprey. The Department is managing the park to allow for recreation while minimizing human impacts on wildlife and habitat.\nContents / Goal 3 Outcomes>", "query_type": "subjective"}

That explains what inspired lawmaker Edward Baliddawa to start the Busoga Tourism Initiative (BTI). Inspired by a friend, Amos Wekesa, a reputed tourism entrepreneur, \"I started reflecting on how Busoga as a region has really not leveraged from the Source of the Nile and other historical landmarks as economic sources,\" Baliddawa explains. He started BTI as a vehicle to coordinate, galvanise and harmonise ideas and efforts towards developing tourism in Busoga.\nA selfless cause He decided that he wanted to be one of the catalysts in the promotion of tourism in Busoga because he hails from this region. He enlisted the support of President Museveni, the Speaker of Parliament, Rebecca Kadaga, fellow legislators and tour operators. On the face of it, one would think that he was doing it to canvass for political capital. Surprisingly, he says he is serving the last term as Member of Parliament for Kigulu North. When Baliddawa kick-started the BTI project, the reactions from the locals were mixed. \"There are those that appreciated my efforts and thus see the potential of tourism to the overall social economic transformation of the region. However, there are also those that need to be sensitised about the benefits of tourism,\" the legislator explains. \"More particularly, there are those, especially my political constituents, who tend to think that as their MP and representative, I should not be spending time in trying to promote any activity such as tourism if it is not within the boundaries of the constituency I represent. So some of these people do not appreciate the broader picture of Busoga in the overall national economic transformation drive,\" he observes. When he started out about three years ago, Baliddawa convinced locals in Busoga and took them to some of these sites to prove to them that there was gold right before their eyes. Baliddawa believes tourism activities like the Busoga Tourism Expo and the three editions of the Kagulu Rock Climbing Challenge are big strides in getting people to appreciate tourism in the region. The Kagulu Rock Climbing Challenge is part of a broader campaign to promote tourism in Busoga. It is a day-long climb up rock tied with other activities. Baliddawa says Busoga's cultural and natural heritage endowments need to be exploited and leveraged, particularly, given its geographical location as a transit centre. The Source of the Nile has been declared a national heritage and Busoga offers opportunities for unique adventures. \"There is need to develop the various tourism sites in Busoga, starting with the re-development of the Source of River Nile as a Busoga's tourism flagship. There is need to document these sites and create a compelling story that the visitors would be able to relate with,\" Baliddawa further explains. \"Although we initially identified more than 32 potential tourism sites in Busoga, for strategic planning reasons, we decided to first focus on three; Kagulu Rock in Buyende District, Bishop James Hannington Memorial Site at Kyando in Mayuge District and Bukaleba Peninsula in Mayuge,\" the tourism enthusiast says. At the initial Kagulu Challenge, both politicians and tourism players like the Association of Uganda Tour Operators joined him. The Kagulu Challenge offers a memorable experience of fun and adventure because it offers a beautiful view of parts of Busoga, Teso and Lango. The site though needs such developments as the hospitality infrastructure in terms of accommodation for visitors and recreational amenities.\nThe challenges But to achieve all this, there is need to document and form a compelling story about these attractions. \"The other challenge is lack of resources to do research, and the actual preparation of the sites for the unveiling. It requires a substantial amount of funding to transform a site from bushes to where it can be appreciated by visitors,\" Baliddawa says. \"The President of Uganda has been very supportive by offering us initial funding. This of course is not enough but we hope to get the private sector on board who should take on to develop these sites further on viable commercial basis,\" he adds.\nWho is Baliddawa?\nBaliddawa holds a bachelor's degree in Economics (Foreign Trade) and an MBA in Management. After graduating, he worked in the Judiciary at the Chief Magistrates Court, Buganda Road Court as a Court Clerk/interpreter for two and half years before going to Yugoslavia for further studies on a government scholarship.

Commissioned by Cosimo I, it was designed by Giorgio Vasari around the middle of the 16th century. In order to realize the project, Vasari had some of the buildings surrounding the area demolished. The intention of Cosimo I was to build a palace that could host the thirteen administrative and judicial Magistrature or Uffizi, from which the palace will get its name. When Vasari died, the construction of the Uffizi was handed over to Buontalenti and to Alfonso Parigi. Buontalenti projected the Teatro Mediceo according to the will of Francesco I, the son of Cosimo I, in 1586. When Florence was the capital of Italy the theatre was the seat of the Senate. The building has the unusual and singular horseshoe shape, also called U shape, which opens towards the Arno River. The two bodies of the building are parallel and conjoined by a connecting corridor that has six big arched windows that open over the courtyard of the palace and over the Arno River. The two floors of the building, divided by stringcourses, stand over a portico that runs along the whole length of the palace and is sustained by pillars. In the niches of the portico are the statues of the Florentines who distinguished themselves from the middle Ages until the 19th century. At the present day the Palazzo degli Uffizi hosts one of the most admired and visited museums in the world for the quality of its artworks and the history that accompanies them from the 13th century to the 18th century: the Uffizi Gallery. In 1993 the Palace was involved in the bombing attack at the Accademia dei Gergofili undergoing damages and loses of inestimable value; another act of vandalism against a patrimony of the world that managed to resist and to win returning, after a long restoration work, to its original splendour. The Uffizi Gallery, founded by Francesco de' Medici to delight himself during his walks, has become through the centuries one of the most famous and admired museums in the world. It was Francesco I de' Medici who created an art Gallery on the second floor of the Palazzo degli Uffizi to delight himself, during his walks, with the collection of paintings, sculptures and arrases belonging to the Medici family. Thanks to Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici the Gallery became a \"public and inalienable good\": the Duchess, in fact, handed it over to the Lorena family providing that it would remain open to the public. At the present day the Uffizi Gallery is one of the most famous and celebrated museums in the world, the symbol of the vocation for collecting and to patronage. An interesting group is represented by the artworks commissioned by the corporations of arts and trades thanks to their economical, cultural and artistic exchanges, Florence has become the world capital of art and, especially a meeting and exchanging landmark for the most important Italian and foreign artists. Other artworks come from private donations, from diplomatic exchanges, from antique convents and dynastic inheritance. Currently 2,000 works of art are on display, while another 1,800 pieces lie in storage. The entrance is located the beginning of the east loggia. On the ground floor, in the rooms originally forming the church of S. Pier Scheraggio, which was incorporated into the palazzo by Vasari, is the series of frescoes of Famous Men by Andrea del Castagno as well as an Annunciation by Botticelli (1481), a fresco detached from the church of S. Martino alla Scala. A large staircase, built by Vasari, leads to the second floor, were the Medici theatre once stood. This area now contains the Gabinetto dei Disegni e delle Stampe, exceptional graphic collection comprising more than 100,000 sheets, from the 14th to the 20th c. If you continue along the large staircase you will reach the third floor, where there are two vestibules, which lead into the gallery and which contain a collection of busts of grand dukes and Roman statues. The visit begins with a walk through the corridors that correspond to the three wings of the buildings.\nFirst corridor\nIn the first corridor the examples of sacred art, of the Renaissance and the artworks by Flemish artists narrate a nostalgic and enlightened past through the alliance between art and spirituality. The entrance hall to the Uffizi Gallery hosts Roman age sculptures belonging to the Medicean collection: plaster moulds and copies which serve as an anti-room to the museum. The first museum serves as an access to the rooms that expose artworks belonging to the 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. Along the perimeter of the corridor is the Medicean collection of head moulds and sculptures placed at regular intervals with one statue and two head moulds. On the vaults are frescoes that represent animals, imaginary monsters, satyrs and feats and Medicean achievements. Under the vaults are the portraits of famous men and rulers from all over the world. The first rooms are dedicated to the art of the 13th and 14th centuries. Here we find examples of sacred art among which the Madonna d'Ognissanti by Giotto, the Maestà di Santa Trinita by Cimabue and the Maestà by Duccio di Buoninsegna. From the 14th century in Florence and Siena the Triptych of San Matteo by Andrea di Cione, the Polyptych of San Pancrazio by Bernardo Daddi and the Presentation to the Temple by Ambrogio Lorenzetti (rooms 3-4). The rooms 5-6 are dedicated to the international Gothic: by Lorenzo Monaco the Adoration of the Magi. Among the artworks of the early Renaissance the Coronation of the Blessed Virgin by Beato Angelico, the Battle of San Romano by Paolo Uccello, Portrait of the Dukes of Urbino by Piero della Francesca (room 7). In the rooms 8 and 9 are the artworks by artists such as Filippo Lippi: the Coronation of the Blessed Virgin, the Adoration of the Magi, by Antonio del Pollaiolo A Female Portrait, Hercules and Antes. Followed by the masterpieces by Botticelli: La calunnia, Primavera, the Birth of Venus, Adoration of the Magi, Madonna della Melagrana, and Coronation of the Blessed Virgin. The Renaissance is celebrated by the paintings by Leonardo among which l'Adorazione dei Magi and the Annunciation and by Perugino la Pietà, (room 15). In the Tribune is the 16th century in Florence with Medicean portraits by Pontormo, By Rosso Fiorentino 'l'Angiolino musicante' and by Andrea del Sarto 'la Dama col Petrarchino'. In a series of adjoining rooms are the works belonging to German art of the 15th and 16th century and paintings from Lombardia and Emilia that evoke mythological tales and detailed Flemish landscapes (rooms 19 -23). Among them you can admire: Adam and Eve by Lukas Cranack, Adoration of the Magi by Andrea Mantegna and the Blessed Virgin adoring the Child by Correggio. Second Corridor\nIn the second corridor, with wide windows, is disclosed an impressive foreshortened view over the city which narrates itself through art. The second corridor, also called 'midday corridor', is certainly one of the most enthralling places of the whole Palazzo degli Uffizi. It's the connecting corridor between the two wings or structures which give the palace its unusual horse-shape. The impressiveness derives from its long windows that enlighten it and from which you can catch a glimpse at some views of Florence: the Ponte Vecchio, the Vasari Corridor, the Arno River, the hills: live postcards flow under the enthusiast eyes of those observing the harmony of the hilly landscapes and the serene gayness of the streets and of the elegant bridges of Florence. On the vaults are the precious grotesque frescoes: among them a painting representing a pergola with birds, flowers and plants and the Virtues of the Medicean Grand Dukes by Nasini. Only the Miniature Cabinet opens on this corridor, originally called Camera degli Idoli (the Room of the Idols) and afterwards Camera di Madama (the Madam Room) since at first it hosted a collection of bronze statues and then the jewels of Cristina di Lorena. On the vault you can admire the Allegory of fame by Filippo Lucci. In the oval room is kept the collection of miniature portraits most of which come from the collection of Leopoldo de' Medici. Very characteristic is the marble pavement. The inlaid marble creates an image of a big carpet. Along the entire corridor, under the frescoed vaults, are the portraits of the rulers from all over the world. Among the sculptures is a Roman copy of Love and Psiche and numerous sculptures from the Roman age: flexuous female bodies and the powerful muscles of heroes and divinities. Third Corridor\nThe 16th century artworks by artists famous worldwide such as Michelangelo, Raffaello Sanzio and Rosso Fiorentino open the collections of the third corridor. Like the two previous ones, the third corridor has grotesque frescoed vaults which depict animals, famous personalities and Medicean achievements. Here as well there are the portraits of the 'Jovian series' with the royalties from all around the world and the Roman statues. The museum's pathway starts again with the rooms 25- 27, which host the Florentine painters of the 16th century: by Michelangelo Buonarroti the Tondo Doni or Sacra Famiglia con San Giovannino; by Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio la Coperta di ritratto; by Raffaello Sanzio la Madonna del cardellino; by Andrea del Sarto la Madonna delle Arpie; by Pontormo Cena in Emmaus and by Rosso Fiorentino la Madonna col Bambino e Santi. In room 28 you can admire Tiziano which is represented as the most illustrious exponent of 16th century Venetian art: by the artist there's la Venere d'Urbino, Flora. Among the examples of Italian painting in Europe in the 16th century (rooms 29-34): by Tintoretto Leda e il cigno (Leda and the swan), by Parmigianino Madonna dal collo lungo (Blessed Mary with a long neck), by Giorgio Vasari La fucina di Vulcano (the furnace of Volcano). Other examples from the 17th century: Rubens with the portrait of Isabella Brandt and Diego Velasquez with Filippo IV of Spain riding a horse. Followed by the room named after the queen Niobe: sculptures based on a mythological theme portraying the woman trying to protect her children from the deadly rage of Apollo and Diana who are shooting fatal arrows against them (room 42). Following there are the 17th century collections through the examples of the Bacchus, The sacrifice of Isaac and Medusa by Caravaggio; by Rembrandt the Juvenile self-portrait and the Venetian foreshortenings and views by Canaletto (room 44). Next to this last room is located the entrance to the bar and to the terrace of the Gallery where you can admire the architectural masterpieces of the city such as the Tower by Arnolfo di Cambio which towers over Palazzo Vecchio and the Cupola by Brunelleschi.

Being elaborated on the basis of the political, cultural, natural, environmental, geological, archaeological, historical, town-planning, architectural, engineering, restoration, legal, and economic analysis, the Strategy of Integrated Conservation and Development of the Historic and Architectural Complex of the Kazan Kremlin made it possible to implement further actions under the Action Program and to ensure the conservation of the Outstanding Universal Value of the Kazan Kremlin. Resulting from the intercommunion of Bolgar, Golden Horde, Kazan Tatar, Russian and present-day Tatar cultures, the Kazan Kremlin and a number of its key properties, including the Annunciation Cathedral (16th to 19th centuries) and the Kul-Sharif Mosque (late 20th century) situated in several metres from each other, are a vivid evidence of the cross-cultural dialogue and cultural diversity under the conditions of multi-confessional and polyethnic society and world globalisation, tolerance in Tatarstan and Russia, and of pilgrimage development. Interaction and interdependence, the correctly chosen combination of restoration, rehabilitation, and preservation tied in a general concept, has allowed creating an integrated museum system of a new type, united with a common idea of discovering a role of Tatarstan and diversity of its historical, cultural, and natural heritage in the history of the Russian Federation, Eurasia, the world in general, its contribution to the world culture, complying with latest international standards and disclosing the potential of the Kazan Kremlin as a World Heritage site. The rescue archaeological excavations and regular scientific archaeological researches have made it possible to work out a new methodology and to prove the thousand-year history of Kazan, Yelabuga and some other cities of Russia and Tatarstan. This methodology has been approved by the Russian Academy of Sciences, Tatarstan Academy of Sciences, public authorities of Tatarstan and Russia. The best practices of interaction between the key partners of the Kazan Kremlin, high personnel potential of the Museum Reserve, educational, competence and adaptation programs, intensive introduction of cultural, scientific, and pilgrimage tourism, promotion of the Kazan Kremlin as a tourist brand and product - all this allows a wide involvement of people in Tatarstan and Russia to the comprehensive preservation of the World Heritage site, its incorporation in the present-day life within the framework of the State policies of economic and social development of Tatarstan and Russia. The combination of traditional (scientific conferences, museum events, tourist sightseeing, website development and updates, etc.) and innovative (information and navigation systems, QR codes, interactive booths and screens, historical reconstruction events, creation of \"live\" museums, holding of massive cultural festivals and projects, such as the Long Night of Museums and Kremlin Live) methods has made it possible to bring the work on the conservation and popularisation of the Outstanding Universal Value of the Kazan Kremlin to a new level. One-off Initiative for the recognition of best practices\nThe World Heritage Capacity Building Strategy, adopted by the World Heritage Committee in 2011, responds to the identified needs of a diverse and growing audience for capacity building for World Heritage conservation and management activities. Development of resource materials such as best practice case studies and communication tools are among the activities foreseen by the strategy to improve these capacities. An example of an innovative capacity building initiative is the recently concluded Recognition of Best Practice in World Heritage Management. This initiative, requested by the World Heritage Committee and carried out within the framework of the 40th anniversary of the World Heritage Convention in 2012, solicited applications from World Heritage properties which had demonstrated new and creative ways of managing their sites. Twenty-three submissions were received and evaluated by a 10-member international selection committee which included the representatives of the Convention's Advisory Bodies, ICCROM, ICOMOS and IUCN. The Historic Town of Vigan in the Philippines was chosen as a best practice achieved with relatively limited resources, a good integration of the local community in many aspects of the sustainable conservation and management of the property and with an interesting multi-faceted approach to the protection of the site.\nManagement practices recognized as being successful and sustainable can include everything from involving local people in site management, to creating innovative policies and regulating tourism. There are sites that include students from local schools in the management of the site (Slovenia), train local inhabitants as tour guides (Peru), or even put up nylon fences to protect villagers from straying tigers from the Sundarbans National Park (India). Sharing these practices helps other sites find solutions that work. This initiative provides incentives for States Parties and site managers to reflect on their management practices and explore improvement possibilities.
