Separate Accounts For Short-Term Investing?\nAs the SEC contemplates new rules for money funds, customized accounts are seen as a possible alternative.\nBy Susan Kelly July 15, 2013 • Reprints\nAs the Securities and Exchange Commission considers tightening its regulations for money market funds, separately managed accounts have been touted as a possible alternative if companies decide to shift assets in response to the new rules. Such accounts are essentially customized money funds; they allow a company to set guidelines for how the money in its account is invested.\n\"It appeals to people, the idea that they can pull together a portfolio that's specific to their needs,\" said Michael Gallanis, a partner at consultancy Treasury Strategies in Chicago. \"If you do not wish to actively manage accounts on your own, this seems to be the next best choice.\"\nGallanis said, though, that few of Treasury Strategies' clients use separately managed accounts.\nThe Association for Financial Professionals' 2013 Liquidity Survey, released last month, shows that 22% of the 885 companies surveyed say their short-term investment policies allow them to use separately managed accounts (SMAs), unchanged from the 2012 survey. But according to the AFP survey, the companies surveyed hold just 3% of their short-term assets in SMAs, also unchanged from the level reported in last year's AFP survey.\nSeparate accounts showed up a little more distinctly when AFP asked companies where they invested funds they moved out of banks when unlimited FDIC insurance expired at the end of last year: 8% of the assets that exited bank accounts were invested in SMAs, while 22% went to Treasury money market funds, 21% to prime money funds, and 15% to Treasury or agency securities.\nThomas Hunt, AFP's director of treasury services, noted that AFP asked specifically about short-term assets and suggested companies might use separate accounts more for assets with longer maturities.\nTyler Haws, director of business development at Clearwater Analytics, which provides investment accounting and reporting, said the pros and cons of using separate accounts for short-term assets vary depending on each company's circumstances. \"If I'm a company that needs all of my cash within a week or two weeks, I'm going to look at the world much differently than someone who knows they don't need 50% of their cash for the next year,\" he said.\nIn general, money market funds \"are convenient, simple and offer same-day liquidity for all my assets,\" Haws said, while a separate account \"is going to be completely customized to the maturity and liquidity needs I would have to meet for my business.\"\nHugh Lamle, president of M.D. Sass Investors Services, a New York-based investment management firm, noted that the company controls the securities in the separately managed account. In fact, if the company has a seasonal need for cash, it could borrow against the securities in its account, Lamle said.\nAt a panel at the New York Cash Exchange conference in May, Bruce Guiot, the chief investment officer at Miami University of Ohio, said that investing in SMAs provides organizations with \"much greater transparency and control.\" Using a separate account entails setting up custodial arrangements for the securities involved, which means an extra layer of fees, Guiot said. But he argued that that setup provides additional fraud control, because it means the investor gets two separate statements each month on the account, one from the investment manager and one from the custodian>", "query_type": "subjective"}

Spot the moment after which gold confiscation by the US government (also known as USD devaluation) from its citizens was legalized. The actual April 5, 1933 order, which in the coming years will make a repeat appearance with absolute certainty, is below.\nWhat was the point of Executive Order 6102? It was two fold. First, in order to make the confiscation legitimate, the US government required the delivery of all gold coin, bullion, and certificates to be concluded by May 1, 1933 in exchange for $20.67/ounce. Several months later, the new, official gold exchange price (which however was merely the government's bid as nobody could actually buy gold at this price) became $35.00, which remained until 1971 when the last trace of the dollar's pseudo convertibility into gold was wiped out by Nixon. In effect, what FDR did was to devalue the USD by 70% overnight. Second, not only did the government remove the incentive for ordinary citizens to hold gold by establishing price and criminal controls over possession, it also changed the rules in the middle of the game allowing it to build up a massive gold hoard of over 8000 tons today which is maintained at Fort Knox, and is, to the best of our knowledge, unauditable by any mere mortal. Critically, it made the US government the sole source and monopoly agent of gold purchases, using reserve fiat currency it could print with impunity, beginning in 1933 and continuing through 1974 when the limitation on gold ownership was repealed after President Gerald Ford signed a bill legalizing private ownership of gold coins, bars and certificates by an act of Congress codified in Pub.L. 93-373, which went into effect December 31, 1974. In summary, the US government, which is now the largest official holder of physical gold in the world, had 40 years of uncontested zero cost gold accumulation in which it could build a gold inventory that was second to none.\nAs for the process the government had in place to deal with those who refused to voluntarily hand over their gold quietly, curiously there was only one case of prosecution, which however should make it very clear that holding gold in \"authorized\" bank safes is about the dumbest thing one can do the next time the US government decides to devalue the dollar, and change the rules.\nThe circumstances of the case were that a New York attorney, Frederick Barber Campbell, had on deposit at Chase National over 5,000 troy ounces (160 kg) of gold. When Campbell attempted to withdraw the gold Chase refused and Campbell sued Chase. A federal prosecutor then indicted Campbell on the following day (September 27, 1933) for failing to surrender his gold. Ultimately, the prosecution of Campbell failed, but the authority of the federal government to seize gold was upheld, and Campbell's gold was confiscated.\nThe fact that the custodial bank of the 5000 ounces of gold is the bank that would subsequently become JPMorgan is not lost on us. Finally, to those who have some gold ETF certificates in a brokerage account, which by law are the possession by DTCC's Cede & Co. - a bank owned institution - we wish the best of luck to anyone hoping to preserve of even recover any of the invested wealth in such instruments. And remember: when in doubt, recall Bernanke's immortal words: \"gold is not money.\"\nReprinted with permission from ZeroHedge.\nJS Kim is the Founder and Managing Director of SmartKnowledgeU, a fiercely independent research & consulting firm that concentrates on providing guidance in using the Precious Metals of Gold & Silver to preserve and grow wealth with a greater mission of fighting for the re-establishment of a sound monetary system worldwide.

As the New York Fed's chief data officer, a role he assumed in February 2009, Bottega was at the epicenter of financial data collection, analysis and dissemination while the bank worked with many of the world's largest financial institutions, the U.S. Treasury and the newly created Office of Financial Research. To help the public and private sectors work together on data management objectives designed to provide transparency into the financial health of many institutions, Bottega tapped into the experience and knowledge he gained from his previous senior data management roles and his work with the Enterprise Data Management Council. Now Bottega is CDO at Bank of America. He recently spoke with Greg MacSweeney, editorial director of Wall Street & Technology, about the changing role of the chief data officer and the growing importance of data in the enterprise.\nWS&T: What knowledge and experience did you gain while at the New York Fed that will help you at Bank of America?\nJohn Bottega, Bank of AmericaJohn Bottega: My experiences as a chief data officer started back at Citi and then continued at the Federal Reserve [of New York]. I worked at the Fed at a very critical time during the financial crisis. Both in the public and private sector during that time, there was a renewed awareness of the importance of data, how important data is to financial stability and how important data is to determining an individual firm's financial health. I say this from the bottom of my heart - that I was very honored to have worked at the Federal Reserve and to be able to do work with the Treasury and the Office of Financial Research. Many of the seeds we planted for work between the public and private sectors are coming to fruition now. WS&T: You've been a CDO for a number of years. How have you seen the role change over the years?\nBottega: It has gone through a rapid evolution. When most firms created a CDO-type position - whether it was a head of market data, a head of reference data, a chief data architect or whatever the actual title - it started as a siloed business focus. Today, it's more of a horizontal responsibility across the enterprise. I've seen this shift not only in the banking industry but also in other industries. You're seeing chief data officers pop up in the medical industry and in government roles. The city of Chicago has a CDO, as does the city of Philadelphia. So, we have seen it grow from being siloed to now taking a much broader view across an enterprise. However, you can't discount the individual work done in each silo, but you need both views [siloed and horizontal] into data to be successful.\nWS&T: You are one of the few CDOs in the industry, which is surprising given financial services' ongoing struggle with data and data standards. Why haven't more data architects risen to the CDO level? Or, why haven't more financial firms created a CDO position?\nBottega: Firms are starting to change. They may not be outright calling it a CDO. I have been contacted by a number of colleagues at other companies who've inquired about how the role has been established and what responsibilities it encompasses. Many firms are recognizing the importance of data and are starting to position themselves for it. Citi has a chief data officer at an executive level. Other banks are starting to move in this direction. You may not see firms calling them chief data officers, but they have established the office and have given data relevance in their organization.\nWS&T: You've worked with the Enterprise Data Management (EDM) Council for seven years. How has it changed data ­management?\nBottega: I have been really fortunate to be part of the EDM Council since it started. To drive change across an industry, it has to happen collaboratively. The EDM Council created a forum where we can get together and have discussions. But they weren't just discussions - we have built some action plans. EDM has been focused on finding common ways to describe data and common semantics. EDM has also been working on the data maturity model, which is a cookbook, if you will, of best practices around data management. These are the results of collaborative exercises with subject-matter experts from across the industry. I think that this is what moves a discipline in an industry, by having the collaboration. They've done that effectively, and that's why EDM has been so good at driving change. There are other industry associations, and they're all important, but EDM and its rifle focus on how to manage information and data has been a game changer in the industry. I certainly hope it continues.\npbug,\nre: The Evolving Role of the CDO I think that John would agree that there is nothing new about data being important; what has changed is 1. regulatory requirements, and 2. companies finally realizing that effective consolidation and analysis of their data has all sorts of benefits.Going back to the early to mid 1990's, I was working as a programmer and DBA in the US operation of a foreign bank.-� Our data was 'locked' in the files of a 20 year old banking system that was very poorly documented, and you needed a programmer who personally knew the file structure to get any data out of them.-� Simple inquiries as to customer balances and transactions were difficult.-� And we kept coming up with new needs for data and each need was separately addressed.-� For instance, we added a credit and market risk analysis system.-� We wrote an ETL link for each of our ancient banking systems to the new system.-� Huge amount of work.-� Our bankers needed a way to easily lookup info on their customers.-� Another ETL and system just for that.-� Then we needed new end of day reports - we finally bought SYBASE and developed a daily ETL for that, just for the daily reports.-�And if you are wondering, NO, I was not the CIO.-� At that point in my career the person who was CIO had little interest in thoughts of anyone below him, let alone mine.-� He never seemed to notice that we kept doing, essentially, the same projects over and over again.-� Each time it was about getting access to the data - but for a single purpose.-� No foresight whatsoever.-�One thing is clear from those days; it was next to impossible to get a clear, complete picture of the business we were doing with a given customer, let alone its profitability or risk.-� But even today there are still plenty of banks with numerous antique systems each operating in complete disregard for the rest of the systems in the same bank.-� One can do daily ETL's to a common database but these day's daily data can be next to useless.-� IOTW, it is well past time for many banks to finally accept that they need unified systems where they can see any data in real time as needed to monitor risk and meet other regulatory needs.

But Mr. Stiglitz, in comments at a conference in Hong Kong on Thursday, charged that quantitative easing, by leading to a weaker U.S. dollar, in fact steals growth from other economies.\n\"President Obama has rightly said that the whole world will benefit if the U.S. grows, but what he forgot to mention is...that competitive devaluation is a form of growth that comes at the expense of others,\" Mr. Stiglitz said at the Mipim Asia real estate conference. \"So I think it is likely to present problems for the global economy going forward.\"\nEmerging-market nations have bristled at the Fed's move to spur the U.S. economy by increasing the U.S. money supply. They worry it will end up instead as a tidal wave of \"hot money\" that will overwhelm smaller, developing economies, creating asset bubbles and inflation. To prevent that, many are establishing or strengthening capital controls, banking regulations that restrict the flow of money into and out of economies. Taiwan and Brazil are the latest to act. South Korea is also considering measures.\nThat patchwork of international capital controls is \"fragmenting the global capital market,\" Mr. Stiglitz said.\nRather than just looser monetary policy, the Columbia University economist urges more government spending by countries whose low borrowing costs make it affordable - notably the U.S.\n\"We really should learn the lesson from China,\" he said. \"If you take money and spend it on investments, then you grow the economy in the short run, but you also grow the economy in the long run.\" He says China's massive infrastructure investments over the past two years have \"changed the economic geography\" of that country, setting it up for strong growth in the years ahead.\nThe U.S. should do the same, he said, adding that because it has funded infrastructure so poorly over the past 20 years, projects will likely have strong positive return on investment.\n\"We have a big list of what we need to do,\" he said. \"We could begin with high-speed railroads. On the list of infrastructure that was drawn up in 2000, at the top of the priority was New Orleans levees. It was public knowledge that New Orleans needed new levees; $5 billion invested in New Orleans levees would have saved $200 billion. Figure out the rate of return on that.\"\nHe recognizes, however, that this dream of a second fiscal stimulus is unlikely to materialize. Much more likely is an extension of the Bush administration's tax cuts, whose \"bang for the buck is very low,\" he said, and which will hurt the federal budget deficit.\nOn the issue of exchange rates, Mr. Stiglitz falls into the emerging-markets camp, led by China, that thinks the system of free-floating rates advocated for decades by the developed world is too volatile.\n\"An ordinary business, they just want to sell products,\" he said. \"With the exchange rate going up and down all over the place...you don't know what you are going to get in return for the sales of your products.\" Financial markets haven't created hedging tools that are good enough and cheap enough to provide protection, he said.\n\"There's a high social cost for the volatility in exchange rates,\" he said. \"So it's very reasonable for governments to stabilize what the markets haven't done a very good job at.\"\nSo if you accept that intervention in currency markets to reduce volatility isn't damaging to the world economy, where does it cross the line and become \"beggar-thy-neighbor\" manipulations? That's the crux of the problem that policymakers at the G-20 are trying to hash out.\nFor instance, China has accumulated $250 billion in reserves this year while letting its currency appreciate only about 3%. Is that too much?\nMr. Stiglitz says China's currency policy is understandable. And he echoed Premier Wen Jiabao's contention that fast currency appreciation would send thousands of Chinese businesses into insolvency.\nGiven the failure of markets to offer adequate protection to export-dependent firms, he said, \"to make sure that the exchange-rate volatility is not such as to force significant number of firms in bankruptcy that have macroeconomic consequences, that is at least the minimal intervention that is appropriate on behalf of government.\"\nBullion Bulls Canada Carpe DiemCoyote BlogCommodity HQ Dollar Vigilante Dragonfly Capital Dr. Housing Bubble Economic Collapse Blog Energy and Capital Grizzly Rock CapitalGold Bullion VaultInvesting AnswersJesse's Cafe AmericainLudwig von Mises InstituteMad Hedge Fund Trader Market Anthropology Miller's Genuine Draft Mish's Global Economic Trends New Trader U Of Two Minds Oil Price Palisades HudsonPeak ProsperityProspecting Journal The Road to Roota Short Takes SHTFPlan Street AuthorityTestosterone PitThe Altucher ConfidentialThe Money Illusion The Technical TakeThe Real Asset Wall Street OasisWealth DailyWyatt Research Zero Hedge\nWealth Wire Copyright © 2014.

Taxes would slowly increase because annual adjustments to income tax brackets would be smaller, pushing more people into higher tax brackets. Over time, fewer people would be eligible for antipoverty programs like Medicaid, Head Start, food stamps, school lunches and home heating assistance because annual adjustments to the poverty level would be smaller, leaving fewer people under the poverty line.\nHouse Republicans proposed the new inflation measure Monday as part of a 10-year, $2.2 trillion plan to avoid the year-end fiscal cliff, a combination of automatic tax increases and spending cuts that economists warn could send the economy back into recession. They also proposed raising the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 67, and raising taxes by $800 billion.\nPresident Barack Obama supported the new inflation measure in deficit-reduction talks last year. That increases the possibility it could become part of a compromise, though White House officials have said they oppose including changes to Social Security in the current talks.\nObama sidestepped the issue when he was asked about it in a broadcast interview Tuesday.\n\"I am willing to look at anything that strengthens our system and makes it, and makes it clear over the long term that the basic social safety net for our seniors is going to be there,\" Obama said on Bloomberg Television.\nThe inflation measure under consideration is called the Chained Consumer Price Index. On average, the measure shows a lower level of inflation than the more widely used Consumer Price Index.\nThe chained CPI assumes that as prices rise, consumers turn to lower-cost alternatives, reducing the amount of inflation they experience. For example, if the price of beef increases while the price of pork does not, people will buy more pork. Or, as opponents argue mockingly, if the price of home heating oil goes up, people will turn down their heat and wear more sweaters.\nThe new inflation measure is unpopular among many Democrats in Congress and advocates for seniors who complain that it would disproportionately hit low-and middle-income families. AARP and other groups have been fighting it for years.\n\"Think about it this way. You're standing on the deck of a boat and you're in very deep water and they want you to swim but they are going to put a log chain around your foot. That's chained CPI,\" Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said at a recent rally on Capitol Hill to oppose cuts to benefit programs. \"One way or the other it's going to drag you to the bottom.\"\nBut the new inflation measure is popular among budget hawks in part because it cuts benefits and increases taxes gradually in ways that might not be readily apparent to most Americans. The savings, however, become substantial over time, adding up to more than $200 billion over the next decade, according to congressional estimates.\n\"It's a proposal with bipartisan support because it more accurately reflects the changes in costs,\" said Michael Steel, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.\nOverall, the proposal would cut Social Security benefits by $102 billion over the next decade, according to an estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It would cut government pensions and veterans' benefits by $21 billion over the same time period. Supplemental Security Income, the disability program for the poor, would be cut by nearly $7 billion\nFor the more than 56 million people who get Social Security, the new measure would reduce annual cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, by an average of 0.3 percentage points each year, according to the Social Security Administration. Next year's increase is scheduled to be 1.7 percent. Under the chained CPI, it would be about 1.4 percent.\nOnce the change is fully phased in, yearly Social Security benefits for a typical middle-income 65-year-old would be about $136 less, according to an analysis of Social Security data. At age 75, annual benefits under the new index would be $560 less. At 85, the cut would be $984 a year.\nThe chained CPI would cut Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, by $12 billion over the next decade. Medicare, the health insurance program for seniors, would see savings of almost $9 billion.\nTaxes, however, would rise by about $65 billion over the same period.\nThe tax increases would hit low-income families the hardest, while high-income taxpayers would see smaller changes, according to a 2011 analysis by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, the official scorekeeper for Congress.\nFor example, by 2021, taxpayers making between $10,000 and $20,000 would see a 14.5 percent increase in their federal taxes with a chained CPI, according to the analysis. Taxpayers making $200,000 to $500,000 a year would get a tax increase of 0.2 percent. People making more than $1 million would get a tax increase of 0.1 percent.>", "query_type": "subjective"}

A nationwide study found that people of below average intelligence were, overall, just about as wealthy as those in similar circumstances but with higher scores on an IQ test.\nFurthermore, a number of extremely intelligent people stated they had gotten themselves into financial difficulty.\n\"People don't become rich just because they are smart,\" said Jay Zagorsky, author of the study and a research scientist at Ohio State University 's Center for Human Resource Research.\n\"Your IQ has really no relationship to your wealth. And being very smart does not protect you from getting into financial difficulty,\" Zagorsky said.\nThe one financial indicator in which the study found it paid to be smart was income. Those with higher IQ scores tended to get paid more than others.\nWhile other research has also found the IQ-income link, this is one of the first studies to go beyond income to look at the relationship between intelligence and wealth and financial difficulty, he said.\n\"Financial success for most people means more than just income,\" Zagorsky said. \"You need to build up wealth to help buffer life's storms and to prepare for retirement. You also shouldn't have to worry about being close to or beyond your financial limits.\"\nZagorsky's study appears online in the journal Intelligence.\nThe study is based on data from 7,403 Americans who participated in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, which is funded primarily by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The NLSY is a nationally representative survey of people, who are now in their mid-40s, conducted by Ohio State's Center for Human Resource Research.\nThe same people have been interviewed repeatedly over time since 1979. This study is based on responses from the 2004 survey.\nParticipants completed the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT), a general aptitude test used by the Department of Defense. Researchers have long used AFQT scores as a measure of intelligence.\nAll participants were also surveyed about their income, total wealth, and three measures of financial difficulty: if they currently have any maxed-out credit cards, if over the past five years they had any instances where they missed paying bills, and whether they ever declared bankruptcy.\nThe results confirmed research by other scholars that show people with higher IQ scores tend to earn higher incomes. In this study, each point increase in IQ scores was associated with $202 to $616 more income per year.\nThis means the average income difference between a person with an IQ score in the normal range (100) and someone in the top 2 percent of society (130) is currently between $6,000 and $18,500 a year.\nBut when it came to total wealth and the likelihood of financial difficulties, people of below average and average intelligence did just fine when compared with the super-intelligent.\nThe study could find no strong relationship between total wealth and intelligence. How could high-IQ people, on average, earn higher incomes but still not have more wealth than others? Zagorsky said this data can't provide an answer, but it suggests that high-IQ people are not saving as much as others. He is currently finishing a study that is exploring that question.\nThe findings revealed mixed results when it came to the link between intelligence and measures of financial distress. For example, the percentage of people who have maxed out their credit cards rises from 7.7 percent in those with an IQ of 75 and below to a peak of 12.1 percent among those with an IQ of 90. Then the percentage falls in an irregular pattern to 5.4 percent among those with an IQ of 115 before rising again.\nThis irregular pattern is also seen among the bankrupt and people who missed bill payments.\n\"In these measures of financial difficulties, it seems that those of slightly better than average intelligence are best off,\" Zagorsky said.\n\"Just because you're smart doesn't mean you don't get into trouble. Among the smartest people, those with IQ scores above 125, even 6 percent of them have maxed out their credit cards and 11 percent occasionally miss payments.\"\nZagorsky said you only have to look in the parking lots of the nation's universities to see that intelligence and wealth are not necessarily linked.\n\"Professors tend to be very smart people,\" he said. \"But if you look at university parking lots, you don't see a lot of Rolls Royces, Porsches or other very expensive cars. Instead you see a lot of old, low-value vehicles.\"\nThe lesson is simple, he said.\n\"Intelligence is not a factor for explaining wealth. Those with low intelligence should not believe they are handicapped, and those with high intelligence should not believe they have an advantage.\"\nSource: Ohio State University\nExplore further: New research says Anne Frank likely died a month earlier\n'Robo-advisor' growth hits Wall Street money managers\nWhen it comes to investment advice, would you trust a financial professional or a robot?\nCyber threats expanding, new US intelligence assessment says\n(AP) - The U.S. has elevated its appraisal of the cyber threat from Russia, the U.S. intelligence chief said Thursday, as he delivered the annual assessment by intelligence agencies of the top dangers facing the country.\nTomorrow's technology will lead to sweeping changes in society\nThroughout history, whenever new technologies have emerged that change our means of production and ability to communicate they have tended to transform society.

Parry offers a contrarian view to the common perception of the Internet as the Wild West of commerce. \"The very vast majority of the fraud that we incur -- such that it is, because we enjoy industry-low levels, both in instance rate and in dollar value terms -- is greater in transactions that involve speaking to someone over the phone or having the culprit standing in front of you at the branch,\" explained Parry. Although Internet fraud certainly exists, it has a limited financial impact, with adequate methods to contain the damage from identity thieves. \"Internet risk, in financial terms, is really quite modest,\" Parry said. \"Ironically, it's probably the safest delivery channel that we have,\" he added. \"It enables us to see activity and behaviors close to real time, rather than wait for batch cycles to clear.\"\nThe mouse click doesn't move money, Parry explained. Rather, the mouse click sends an instruction to move money at a later point in time. As a result, Internet transactions have a built-in delay relative to other channels such as the ATM, branch or the point of sale. The delay provides banks with an opportunity to detect behaviors indicative of a fraud attempt. For example, if a customer appears to be sending money to a type of business with which he or she has never transacted before, the bank has an opportunity to call the customer to investigate. However, rapid response to customer interactions requires access to real-time enterprise data. \"If it's not a real-time transaction data warehouse, if it's just a storage house, you're operating in batch, and you're not detecting anything,\" noted Parry. Other customer channels also could benefit from this approach. \"Nothing that we do on the Internet is anything that we shouldn't be doing at the ATM and at the branch,\" said Parry. \"Centralized, real-time, transaction-level data warehouses help you accomplish that.\"\nRather than a lurching, stopgap approach to security that attempts to foil every attempt to steal information in a data-rich world, Parry instead advocates that banks focus on actual customer interactions, including non-financial interactions such as a change of address. Such an approach can benefit a bank and its customers alike. \"To say, 'We've lost some money, but don't worry, Reg E will ensure that you're [made] whole,' is quite different from, 'We detected an attack on your account and we've taken care of it,'\" said Parry. \"That's a very different customer experience around fraud management.\"\nWhile it may not stop the parade of embarrassing data breaches nor silence the gleeful press watching the parade, the transaction-centered approach may be enough to protect both customers and shareholders alike. \"You have to manage risk on the assumption that all data is out there, because to not do that is simply irresponsible,\" said Parry.

But Mr. Stiglitz, in comments at a conference in Hong Kong on Thursday, charged that quantitative easing, by leading to a weaker U.S. dollar, in fact steals growth from other economies.\n\"President Obama has rightly said that the whole world will benefit if the U.S. grows, but what he forgot to mention is...that competitive devaluation is a form of growth that comes at the expense of others,\" Mr. Stiglitz said at the Mipim Asia real estate conference. \"So I think it is likely to present problems for the global economy going forward.\"\nEmerging-market nations have bristled at the Fed's move to spur the U.S. economy by increasing the U.S. money supply. They worry it will end up instead as a tidal wave of \"hot money\" that will overwhelm smaller, developing economies, creating asset bubbles and inflation. To prevent that, many are establishing or strengthening capital controls, banking regulations that restrict the flow of money into and out of economies. Taiwan and Brazil are the latest to act. South Korea is also considering measures.\nThat patchwork of international capital controls is \"fragmenting the global capital market,\" Mr. Stiglitz said.\nRather than just looser monetary policy, the Columbia University economist urges more government spending by countries whose low borrowing costs make it affordable - notably the U.S.\n\"We really should learn the lesson from China,\" he said. \"If you take money and spend it on investments, then you grow the economy in the short run, but you also grow the economy in the long run.\" He says China's massive infrastructure investments over the past two years have \"changed the economic geography\" of that country, setting it up for strong growth in the years ahead.\nThe U.S. should do the same, he said, adding that because it has funded infrastructure so poorly over the past 20 years, projects will likely have strong positive return on investment.\n\"We have a big list of what we need to do,\" he said. \"We could begin with high-speed railroads. On the list of infrastructure that was drawn up in 2000, at the top of the priority was New Orleans levees. It was public knowledge that New Orleans needed new levees; $5 billion invested in New Orleans levees would have saved $200 billion. Figure out the rate of return on that.\"\nHe recognizes, however, that this dream of a second fiscal stimulus is unlikely to materialize. Much more likely is an extension of the Bush administration's tax cuts, whose \"bang for the buck is very low,\" he said, and which will hurt the federal budget deficit.\nOn the issue of exchange rates, Mr. Stiglitz falls into the emerging-markets camp, led by China, that thinks the system of free-floating rates advocated for decades by the developed world is too volatile.\n\"An ordinary business, they just want to sell products,\" he said. \"With the exchange rate going up and down all over the place...you don't know what you are going to get in return for the sales of your products.\" Financial markets haven't created hedging tools that are good enough and cheap enough to provide protection, he said.\n\"There's a high social cost for the volatility in exchange rates,\" he said. \"So it's very reasonable for governments to stabilize what the markets haven't done a very good job at.\"\nSo if you accept that intervention in currency markets to reduce volatility isn't damaging to the world economy, where does it cross the line and become \"beggar-thy-neighbor\" manipulations? That's the crux of the problem that policymakers at the G-20 are trying to hash out.\nFor instance, China has accumulated $250 billion in reserves this year while letting its currency appreciate only about 3%. Is that too much?\nMr. Stiglitz says China's currency policy is understandable. And he echoed Premier Wen Jiabao's contention that fast currency appreciation would send thousands of Chinese businesses into insolvency.\nGiven the failure of markets to offer adequate protection to export-dependent firms, he said, \"to make sure that the exchange-rate volatility is not such as to force significant number of firms in bankruptcy that have macroeconomic consequences, that is at least the minimal intervention that is appropriate on behalf of government.\"\nBullion Bulls Canada Carpe DiemCoyote BlogCommodity HQ Dollar Vigilante Dragonfly Capital Dr. Housing Bubble Economic Collapse Blog Energy and Capital Grizzly Rock CapitalGold Bullion VaultInvesting AnswersJesse's Cafe AmericainLudwig von Mises InstituteMad Hedge Fund Trader Market Anthropology Miller's Genuine Draft Mish's Global Economic Trends New Trader U Of Two Minds Oil Price Palisades HudsonPeak ProsperityProspecting Journal The Road to Roota Short Takes SHTFPlan Street AuthorityTestosterone PitThe Altucher ConfidentialThe Money Illusion The Technical TakeThe Real Asset Wall Street OasisWealth DailyWyatt Research Zero Hedge\nWealth Wire Copyright © 2014.

Islamic finance, which has its core markets in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, follows religious principles that ban interest and shun outright speculation.\nAs such, Islamic bank balance sheets were free from sub-prime loans and structured products that turned sour in 2007, triggering a chain of events that threatened to cause a global financial meltdown.\nBut the IFSB study, which relied on an analysis of data from 52 full-fledged Islamic banks, found that they were not fully insulated from the crisis.\nEconomic slowdown, declining trends of commodity prices, and real estate crises that emanated from the financial crisis also affected Islamic banking performance, the report said.\nIt estimated net profit margins of Islamic banks had recovered to 1.06 per cent by 2012, from a low of 0.87 per cent in 2009 but still below 2.9 per cent in 2007, before the global crisis.\nAsset quality was also in the spotlight: non-performing loans peaked at 6.03 per cent in 2010, with banks in the UAE, Bahrain and Kuwait some of the worst-affected partly due to greater exposure to real estate. This meant Islamic banks in those countries fared worse in terms of asset quality than their conventional peers.\nSuch exposure to real estate remains in the double-digits with no significant changes forecast, although the outlook for the Gulf's real estate sector is now positive, the report said.\nLimited fx deposits\nCapitalisation levels have been a bright spot for Islamic banks, with levels consistently above those of conventional banks, although there is a catch.\nIslamic banks have generally maintained higher levels of regulatory capital, in part, due to an absence of well-functioning and healthy Islamic interbank money markets, IFSB said.\nWhile liquidity has been a perennial concern, the introduction last year of Sharia-compliant money market instruments by the International Islamic Liquidity Management Corp (IILM) has helped close this gap. The IILM is now regularly issuing short-term Islamic paper since its three-month $490 million (Dh1.8 billion) debut last August, and it is expected to ramp up issuance, the report said.\nA lack of foreign currency deposits is also limiting the industry's ability to expand its customer base, with less than 10 per cent of Islamic bank deposits held in foreign currencies across all countries except in Turkey and the UAE.\nSukuk, or Islamic bonds, have been a bright spot for the industry but these are also exposed to risks of withdrawal from conventional investors, the report said.\nInvestors with no specific Sharia-compliant investment mandate could withdraw from sukuk in favour of higher-yielding conventional instruments and further research would be needed to evaluate those risks.

If a business is like a football team, the chief compliance officer (CCO) may end up like the starting left tackle. If he does not protect the quarterback, he'll lose his job. Now, if the CCO fails to do everything possible to prevent a compliance breach, then he or she may be the one facing penalties.\n\"There's been lots of press around pretty strong enforcement of laws, hefty fines and that sort of thing. A number of companies have been heavily fined,\" says Jodi Golinsky, a seasoned in-house lawyer with compliance experience at a number of financial institutions. \"This has led to a greater emphasis on a culture of compliance, building up to levels greater than we have seen before.\"\nThis is due, in part, to large fines and criminal enforcements that have been brought against companies found to be out of compliance with federal regulations. When a regulatory body like the SEC investigates a company, it must decide whether or not to pursue enforcement actions. If it does so, and if it finds egregious violations, it can take any number of enforcement actions, up to and including fining or charging a chief compliance officer.\nIf there's one person who has a clear insight into the process involved in SEC investigations, it's Merri Jo Gillette, partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP's litigation practice. Gillette spent more than 28 years at the SEC, eventually serving director of the SEC's Chicago office.\nIn her time at the SEC, Gillette saw thousands of cases and examinations, and witnessed a number of sweeping changes in the power and scope of the SEC. One of the biggest changes was the creation of the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE).\nIn the wake of the Madoff case, OCIE refocused its program, moving to a risk-based examination process with a national governance structure that sets all priorities and policies for the SEC's national exam program.\" Also, in the past five years or so, the Division of Enforcement reorganized itself, creating five specialty units with people assigned to those units who are dedicated to bringing cases within the subject matter of their specialty.\nWith all of these changes, according to Gillette, the SEC now looks at firms in a more holistic fashion.\n\"From an SEC perspective, a compliance program is reflected in the entire environment, the specifics and substance of the procedures and the way a program is structured as well as the resources allocated to compliance within the firm and the compliance tone within the firm,\" she explains.\nThe SEC staff looks at businesses from several perspectives, including risk to investors, customers, clients and the marketplace, risk to fair and equitable operations of markets and risk to the financial firm or entity.\nOnce a firm is under investigation, there are a number of factors the SEC takes into account when deciding whether to take enforcement action against that company. \"It's not so much a checklist as a nuanced weighing of several factors, each weighing in favor or against bringing enforcement action,\" Gillette explains. Factors include the egregiousness of the alleged misconduct, the direct benefit to the company as a result of the violation, whether the misconduct was systemic or isolated and the level of intent or responsibility of the wrongdoers within the company.\nAll of these factors come into play and what the SEC discovers will influence it in one direction or another. For example, if someone intentionally took steps to defraud investors, or acted recklessly in violation of obligations under the federal securities laws, that would cause the pendulum to swing toward enforcement actions. On the other hand, if the company was misled by a small subset of wrongdoers within the company and, even with strong compliance procedures and controls, it might have been difficult for the company to detect the misconduct, that would swing the pendulum away from an enforcement action against the company.\nWhen deciding to take action, it is rare that the SEC will sue a chief compliance officer just because he or she holds that position, Gillette explains. In making a decision about enforcement charges against a CCO, there are a number of questions that arise.\n\"First and foremost, the question of whether the CCO engaged in misconduct will be raised. The SEC staff may also look at the program in place. Did the CCO lead or direct the risk assessment process and development of the procedures in the organization? Was the CCO appropriately knowledgeable about the business itself and where the risks might arise within the firm or the marketplace? Was the CCO aware of rules and regulations that apply in all areas pertinent to the firm's business, or developments in the law or the industry that should have caused him or her to revisit a compliance policy or develop a new one?\"\nIf the CCO was trying to do the right thing in an environment where the firm is not providing adequate compliance resources or where management is not following the CCO's advice, that will be another variable the the SEC staff would factor those additional variables into its decision. On the other hand, Gillette warns, \"If the risk is great enough and management's ear is deaf enough, the CCO might have an obligation to ensure that misconduct is brought to the attention of the regulator or to walk away from the company.\" Though, she points out, this would be an extreme example.\nJust like a left tackle in football that protects the quarterback's blind side, the CCO plays an increasingly important business role. The SEC sees it as a critical role, enabling stronger compliance across industries, and the Commission is looking to partner with CCOs to create robust programs at their firms.\nA game of risk\nOne tack that companies can take to create these robust programs and minimize the chance of enforcement actions from the SEC is to focus on risk. \"It's important that programs be risk-based, that organizations do a risk assessment of where they are truly vulnerable,\" says Donna Epps, partner at Deloitte Financial Advisory Services LLP.\n\"In a global environment, risks change quickly... programs need to be flexible and you need to be constantly kicking the tires, to see if what you believed were the top risks yesterday are still the top risks. Look at the process and make sure there is not a gap between what you do and what your program's goals are.\"\nJust as the SEC looks at a firm holistically, Epps emphasizes that compliance should be an integrated part of business operations. Having the right corporate culture and leadership from the top down, as well as integrating compliance in the business end of operations, can go a long way toward ensuring that these matters are taken seriously, proactively preventing any potential trouble.\nCompliance problems are a serious matter, and companies must work to avoid them at all costs. With the right compliance procedures in place, they can beef up their offensive line and protect the quarterback - at least long enough for him to make that deep throw.

The money collected would be earmarked for different funds and non-profit organizations and in turn distributed to schools, hospitals and local governments, according to Occupy organizers and proponents of the legislation.\nAndrew Smith, an Occupy organizer, said similar Robin Hood tax laws have been imposed in 11 euro zone countries, including Germany and France.\n\"This kind of tax stream has globally become a very accepted form of revenue generation,\" he said.\nThree people were arrested on Tuesday for wearing masks at the downtown rally, which drew a crowd of about 100 activists, a far cry from the thousands the group had in its heyday.\nOrganizers expected about 1,000 people later in the day to assemble for a rally front of the United Nations, with plans to march to the headquarters of JPMorgan Chase & Co and the Metropolitan Transit Authority, New York City's mass transit agency.\nThe rallies come two years after Occupy demonstrators first set up camp in Zuccotti Park near the NYSE to call for changes in how financial institutions are regulated. The movement quickly spread to cities around the world and spinoff \"Occupy\" groups have been set up to address everything from disaster relief to human rights.\nThe Occupy Wall Street camp in New York City was finally evicted by Mayor Michael Bloomberg in November 2011.\nIn focusing attention on the \"Robin Hood Tax,\" Occupy organizers also hope to counter criticism that the Occupy Wall Street movement was too broad and lacked a clear goal.\n\"Occupy broke the crust in giving people broad narratives about income disparity,\" Smith said. \"Now people want answers and I think the Robin Hood Tax is an answer.\"\nCritics of the tax say the law it would decrease the volume of financial transactions on Wall Street, prompting companies to move overseas, taking jobs and money with them.\nWith the passage of a financial transaction tax \"thousands of high-paying jobs would leave the U.S., sharply reducing employment at hundreds of non-financial companies that depend on these customers,\" the conservative Heritage Foundation said in a report released earlier this year.\n(Editing by Scott Malone and Richard Chang)>", "query_type": "subjective"}

The future of banking in MENA is technology-led [2] and innovations such as in-memory computing, mobile and cloud are set to play an increasingly influential role, senior banking executives and leading industry experts agreed.\"Banks need innovations such as cloud computing. Lack of transaction visibility and control, a lack of agility, multiple failure points and complex infrastructures, as well as considerable maintenance and expertise costs means they simply cannot be ignored,\" said Ross Wainwright, Global Head of Financial Services Industries, SAP.Banks are expected to spend almost $180 billion on IT this year, according to research company Celent. But while cloud-based services currently account for a fraction of this, some estimates predict spending by financial-services firms on the public, private and hybrid cloud solutions will total $26 billion in 2015.A recent PricewaterhouseCoopers survey of financial services executives supports this notion of momentum. Seventy one percent said they will invest more in cloud computing this year  -  up from 18 percent who said the same in 2012. In addition, 50 percent plan to invest in private cloud technology. [3]Wainwright's comments come as the MENA region as a whole is starting to look to the cloud more than ever before. Gartner predicts that MENA is projected to experience one of the highest global growth rates for public cloud services, increasing from 2012 to 2013 by 24.5 percent to $462.3 million. The UAE is likely to be particularly active in this respect, with IDC predicting annual compound growth of 43.7 percent until 2016.Wainwright spoke on a panel at SIBOS recently alongside Emirates NBD, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citi and Deutsche Bank. He explained that demands for greater innovation in the financial service industry had aggressively driven the creation of the SAP Financial Services Network (FSN), which connects corporate customers with their financial services providers in the cloud. \"What corporate treasurers need is a faster, simpler way to connect to their banking partners that could also provide a consolidated view of their enterprise's financial positions and real-time access to all of their banking information. That could happen in the cloud\".\"A single service could connect banks and corporate treasuries, enabling them to share data - including payments, payment statuses, and statements - as well as automate collections, reconciliations, settlement updates, financial reporting, and other key processes on a common platform. More importantly, it could also serve as a foundation upon which to build analytics applications that harness all of that data,\" said Wainwright.Until now, corporates have tended to deal with their bank or banks over point-to-point, proprietary connection - a situation that creates multiple silos of information and makes it more difficult to gain a single view of their positions and liquidity across all institutions. Hosted by SAP as an on-demand offering, the SAP FSN is a bank-to-corporate connectivity service in the form of a network, over which the two sides will be able to communicate. Corporate customers can authorize payments and interrogate their accounts with real-time analytical tools, while the banks can use it not only for timely reporting but also, SAP said, to offer additional services as and when they detect opportunities from the analysis of their customers' transactions.The network is also intended to facilitate core transaction management among banks, corporations and treasury service providers. As part of the development of the network, banks and corporations are continuously contributing their expertise and resources to create a real-world road map that helps deliver full financial integration, connectivity and service among all participants.\"Banking is undergoing massive and rapid transformation, and its future in MENA will be powerfully influenced and led by technology,\" said Sam Alkharrat, Managing Director, SAP MENA.\"Increasingly, we will see market forces and customer demands force banks to incorporate technologies related to the cloud, mobile, analytics, applications and database and technology. Institutions that want to lead, innovate, retain custom and unlock new opportunities simply cannot afford to stand still - particularly against the backdrop of MENA's cutting-edge development agendas. The step-change in this industry is unavoidable and hugely exciting, and I am proud to say that SAP is playing a leading role in making it all happen.\"Receptivity for ground-breaking solutions like the FSN will be buoyed by SAP's already strong profile in MENA's financial services sector - a fact that was underscored by both Emirates NBD and Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank at SIBOS today.Emirates NBD explained how it turned to SAP when it was making efforts to cope with the effect of rapid growth on its ability to accumulate and analyze customer and transaction data. Emirates NBD opted to employ database software that could keep up with the complexity of the challenge, including reducing the time required for analysts to receive reports. This approach would also help minimize storage expenses\n[4] © Copyright 2013 The Saudi Gazette. All Rights Reserved. Source URL: \n[2] \n[3] \n[4]>", "query_type": "subjective"}

And although, from a jurisdictional standpoint, the institutional mandate stressed the areas of exchange and current payments, the aim of a liberal trade system was at the core of the spirit of the code of conduct.47 In its operations with members, the IMF was also interested in attaining other related aims and in resolving balance of payments problems.48\nSince Bretton Woods, the emphasis given to what may generally be called microeconomic issues (those having to do with efficiency in resource use), relative to that given to macroeconomic issues (those dealing with the balance between the aggregate demand for and availability of resources), has tended to increase. Perhaps to an important extent, the shift has reflected the fact that economic imbalances tend to increase in complexity in settings where discretion is the norm rather than the exception. This section will focus on three of the most conspicuous areas of concern.\nStructural Adjustment and Growth\nIn a system where members adopt the exchange arrangement of their choice, subject to constraints aimed at protecting the interests of the membership at large, the concept of an appropriate balance of payments position is not easy to define operationally. The relevant notion is sustainability or viability of the external payments position, which implies a time framework, and not a particularly short one at that. If external imbalance means that the balance of payments has reached a clearly unsustainable position, then the focus of policy must be on restoring viability to the balance of payments over the medium term. This concept includes objectives such as a sound growth rate and relatively stable price performance. Thus, although the balance of payments may remain the primary objective of surveillance and conditionality, the attainment of growth and price stability becomes an integral part of IMF functions. From this vantage point, it may be argued that trade-offs often perceived between balance of payments and price or output outcomes are more apparent than real and that the actual choice is instead between problems today versus problems tomorrow.49\nThis is the background for the development of the extended Fund facility (EFF) and of the enlarged time horizon for IMF stand-by arrangements. The concern was that balance of payments results achieved at the expense of domestic imbalances (such as sustained periods of growth below potential) would prove to be as short-lived as the attainment of domestic objectives (such as price stability or above potential growth) at the expense of balance of payments deficits. This meant an expansion of the policy understandings between the IMF and its members. It also meant an increasingly close relationship with the World Bank, which in a similar vein initiated its structural adjustment lending program, involving the extension of policy-based loans.50\nCapital Flows and External Debt\nThe Bretton Woods order and the amended version of the Articles of Agreement currently in effect focused on attaining freedom of transactions at the current account level. The period that followed the abandonment of the par value system witnessed an unprecedented increase in international capital flows, particularly in the form of contractual lending. These growing transactions were instrumental in safeguarding interdependence in the international economy and as such were perceived as an indication of the resilience of the international financial system. But they also exhibited characteristics that caused problems to develop at a later stage. These were the predominance of contractual lending to sovereign borrowers and the resulting change in the structure or composition of capital flows. Capital movements rose markedly in scale but not uniformly across the full range of the various possible types of flows. Their main channels were commercial bank loans.\nIt is now a matter of historical record how these capital account developments led to a severe international debt crisis that seriously strained the fabric of the international financial system. Although the debt strategy that was adopted in response proved remarkably successful in achieving its central aim of eliminating the systemic threat, individual country debt problems are still outstanding.51 The international economy still confronts the fundamental challenge of setting the conditions for restoring normality to capital flows. And normality consists not only of the resumption of those flows on an appropriate scale but also of restoring balance to the structure of capital movements. That restoration should enable private foreign direct investment and equity flows to become important channels for resource transfers. Such a development, important at all times, can be critical at present to help along the reforms under way in previously centrally planned economies.\nOf interest in this cont>", "query_type": "subjective"}

If the banks are permeable what is the likelihood that other systems are?John Bumgarner of the US Cyber Consequences Unit, a non-profit group that studies the impact of cyberthreats, cautioned against rushing to assign blame for the attacks.\"There is no irrefutable evidence that the Iranian government was responsible,\" Bumgarner said.>", "query_type": "subjective"}

While the world economy is booming for the fourth consecutive year, with a historically unprecedented growth rate of about 5 percent, the French economy is limping. In 2006, it grew by only 2.2 percent, while growth rates of only 2.1 percent and 1.9 percent can be expected for 2007 and 2008, respectively, according to a recent forecast by the German Economic Research Institutes. This is significantly below the average of the old EU countries for these three years  -  2.7 percent, 2.6 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively.\nFrance is currently one of Europe's laggards, only slightly ahead of Italy and Portugal. Even Germany is performing better. With a growth rate of 2.7 percent, the German economy clawed its way back to the average of the old EU countries in 2006, and it can be expected to grow at 2.4 percent in 2007 and 2008, far faster than France.\nFrance's meager growth is surprising. Until recently, the economy was doing fairly well, outperforming many EU countries. While Germany grew by only 14 percent in the 10 years from 1995 to 2005, ranking as Europe's \"vice-laggard\" next to Italy, France grew by 23.6 percent, which was nearly the old EU countries' average of 24.3 percent. In 2001, France's gross national income per capita overtook that of Germany, and is now 4 percent higher. And yet recent growth figures seem to have reversed this trend for the time being.\nFrench employment data has been worrisome for even longer. In 2006, France's unemployment rate was 9.4 percent, a full percentage point higher than Germany's. By 2008, the French rate can be expected to decline only to 8.2 percent, while German unemployment is anticipated to fall to 6.3 percent.\nA similar pattern holds for public debt. While Germany has resolved its debt problem insofar as it no longer violates the European Union's Stability and Growth Pact and can be expected to have a balanced budget in 2008, the forecasts for France imply deficits of 2.6 percent and 2.3 percent of GDP for this year and 2008. If the boom in the world economy falters, France will again violate the Stability and Growth Pact, as it did in 2002, 2003 and 2004.\nWhy are France and Germany behaving so differently during this global boom? Among the potential explanations, the dissimilar specializations of each country stand out. While France has specialized in consumer goods such as food and pharmaceutical products, Germany is a leading exporter of investment goods. As the current boom in the world economy is largely fueled by investment demand rather consumption demand, only Germany profits from it to full measure.\nGermany is the toolshop of the world, with 450 world-market leaders in niche products and another 500 companies in the top-three category. Fifteen of the world's 20 biggest trade fairs (measured by indoor exhibition space) are held in Germany, and the country tops the list in world commodity exports. Small wonder, then, that Germany's economy rockets when the world's demand for capital goods soars.\nTrue, Germany has its share of problems. The country is gradually turning into an industrial bazaar that is relocating its workbench to low-wage ex-communist countries. This is one of the reasons why the boom of 2006 was incapable of creating additional jobs in German manufacturing; why Germany still has the OECD's highest unemployment among low-skilled workers; and why aggregate full-time employment has not yet returned to its level in 2000.\nThe French economy could be slightly more stable in the medium term insofar as it seems to have more solid internal sectors. But Germany definitely is partaking more of the current boom than France does.\nPerhaps one French mistake was to neglect its small and medium-size firms and specialize too much on state-controlled mega-companies. Airbus, Renault, Credit Lyonnais and Alstom are well-known examples of a mistaken industrial policy that has wasted French taxpayers' money  -  and that is partly connected with the name Sarkozy.\nThe true problem for France is the huge chunk of state-owned companies that go through the motions without being particularly successful in the market. In France, 25 percent of dependent employees work in the government sector, compared with 19 percent in the old EU and 12 percent in Germany. The French government share in GDP is 54 percent, while Germany's is only 47 percent.\nIn France, more than 7 percent of voters cast their ballots for Trotskyite and Communist candidates in the first round of the presidential election, while the Socialists, who received 27 percent of the votes, are much more left-leaning than Germany's Social Democrats. Dirigiste attitudes are more popular in France than in most other European countries. To the extent that these attitudes may have led to a political system in which small and medium-size firms find it difficult to flourish, they may have contributed to France's problems.\nIt remains to be seen whether the new French president will be able to embark on a more promising course. The odds are not good. Royal will do nothing to increase the flexibility of the French labor market so as to facilitate structural change and enable new firms to be created, while Sarkozy is likely to continue to support France's lumbering giants, as he as done so frequently in the past. Sound policy aimed at reviving the economy seems beyond the grasp of both candidates.\nJapan misses chance as Abe looks backward\nConfronting unending lies\nOnly one practical solution to Ukraine crisis\nImmigration reform will benefit both U.S. and Asia>", "query_type": "subjective"}

Results of the survey were released Thursday by the U.S. Council for International Business (USCIB), ICC's American affiliate.\nAround 60 percent of respondents indicated that the demand for trade in Asia will show improvement in 2012, while close to 50 percent of respondents predicted a further deterioration for the euro area, USCIB said.\n\"These results illustrate how far, and how fast, the ripples from the euro crisis are spreading,\" said Michael F. Quinn, managing director with JP Morgan Global Trade and chairman of USCIB's Banking Committee. \"The withdrawal of European banks from global trade finance has had a major impact on the ability of companies to arrange for trade finance in many markets, and we expect this to continue into the future.\"\nFactors contributing to the negative outlook for 2012 were primarily financial constraints that reduce the availability of trade finance, the organizations said.\n\"This was particularly acute for large banks and those with business in developing countries,\" they added. \"Some 90 percent of respondents indicated that 'less credit or liquidity available at counterparty banks' would affect their trade finance activities either to a 'large extent' or to 'some extent.' This share is substantially higher than the just over 50 percent that noted the same during the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\"\nThe financial constraints appeared to reflect the large share of trade finance coming from euro-area banks. The survey showed that recent European bank deleveraging has led to tighter lending guidelines and reduced availability of credit and liquidity. In addition, U.S. dollar funding for non-U.S. financial institutions may exacerbate the situation, since trade remained largely denominated in U.S. dollars.  -  Eric Johnson>", "query_type": "subjective"}

Mutual funds must start filing SARs 180 days after the date of the publication of the final rule in the Federal Register. The final rule will be published in the Federal Register on May 4, 2006.\nThe final rule announced today creates a suspicious transaction reporting requirement that is uniform with reporting requirements already established for other financial institutions, such as banks, broker-dealers, casinos, and money services businesses. Since May 2003, mutual funds have been subject to the rule requiring that they develop and implement anti-money laundering programs designed to prevent them from being used to launder money or finance terrorist activities.\n\"This final rule is another step in ensuring that the Bank Secrecy Act is applied appropriately to financial institutions, such as mutual funds, to create systems for preventing and detecting potential abuse by those seeking to launder money or finance terrorism,\" said Robert W. Werner, Director of FinCEN. \"Suspicious activity reporting by mutual funds is expected to provide highly useful information to both law enforcement and regulators and will be an additional tool to protect the U.S. financial system from terrorism and other illicit finance.\"\nThe final rule for mutual funds specifies four categories of transactions that require reporting:\nTransactions involving funds derived from illegal activity, or intended or conducted in order to hide or disguise funds derived from such illegal activity as part of a plan to violate or evade any federal law or regulation or to avoid any transaction reporting requirement under federal law or regulation;\nTransactions designed, whether through structuring or other means, to evade the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act;\nTransactions that appear to serve no business or apparent lawful purposes, and for which the mutual fund knows of no reasonable explanation after examining the available facts relating to the transaction and the parties; and Transactions that involve the use of the mutual fund to facilitate criminal activity.\nMutual funds must report suspicious transactions that are conducted or attempted by, at, or through a mutual fund that involve or aggregate at least $5,000 in funds or other assets. The obligation to report applies regardless of whether the transaction involves currency. Mutual funds are also encouraged to voluntarily report a suspected violation of the law that involves less than the $5,000 threshold.\nMutual funds must use FinCEN Form 101 (Suspicious Activity Report by the Securities and Futures Industries) to report any suspicious transactions. FinCEN also will be issuing shortly a series of Frequently Asked Questions that are designed to assist mutual funds in establishing their suspicious activity reporting programs. Financial institutions may also call the FinCEN Regulatory Helpline at 800-949-2732 for assistance.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates the mutual fund industry, has been delegated the authority to examine mutual funds for compliance with the final rule.\nFinal Rule: Requirement to Report Suspicious Transactions>", "query_type": "subjective"}

Print this page\nState Capacity, Economic Crisis and Economic Reform: Implications for Sustainability\nModule by: Adriana Maestas. E-mail the author\nSummary: Sustainability Seminar recorded on March 2, 2011, delivered by Georgetown University Professor George Shambaugh.\nLike the economic crises in Korea in 1997 and Argentina in 2001, U.S. and European responses to the 2008-2011 financial crises are less about what particular strategy is most likely to succeed or who specifically will be bailed out, than they are about the capacity of national governments to overhaul their economies and restore confidence in the global markets. Whether adopting neo-Keynesian, monetarist, or neo-liberal reforms or whether rescuing Wall Street or auto makers, state capacity is essential. Enhanced capacity increases a nation-state's ability to manage the market and has a significant positive effect on the economy by decreasing uncertainty; thus enhancing consumer and investor confidence. Low levels of state capacity compound market uncertainty with political uncertainty. This weakens bargaining strength and undermines confidence in both political leadership and the economy. Understanding how the power of, and distribution of power between, economic and political elites affects the capacity of national governments to manage markets effectively (whether this involves negotiating with labor unions, entrenched corporate and financial groups, domestic and international investors, foreign governments, or international financial institutions), enables us to predict recurring patterns of political exuberance, economic exuberance, economic policy inertia, and credible economic policy reform. These patterns of behavior help to explain the evolution of national economic policies that triggered economic crises in Asia and Latin America a decade ago and the United States and Europe today. They have also shaped national responses to these crises and, as a consequence, confidence in national and global economies.\n[show links]\n[hide links]\nPrerequisite links\nThis work is licensed by Adriana Maestas under a Creative Commons Attribution License (CC-BY 3.0), and is an Open Educational Resource.

Remittance flows from the gulf countries to South Asia increased in 2008.\nLike housing values and stock markets, it once seemed as if the global value of remittances could only go up. Remittances to developing countries increased 18 percent in 2006 ($229 billion in all) and 16 percent in 2007 ($265 billion), according to World Bank estimates.\nRemittances are widely considered an exceptionally stable source of development finance that actually increases when the economic climate sours in developing countries. The big question now is how they will fare when countries around the world are being pinched by outright recession or economic turmoil.\n\"We are in unknown territory now because both the source countries and the destination countries are not doing very well,\" World Bank Senior Economist Dilip Ratha said recently.\nThe data available for 2008 present a mixed picture. The World Bank reported in November that remittances for 2008 are expected to be about $283 billion, a 7 percent increase. Flows from the gulf countries to South Asia have grown quickly in 2008; in contrast, flows from the United States to Latin America and the Caribbean and those from Western Europe to Europe and Central Asia have been slowing.\nKenya, the Philippines, Pakistan, and Bangladesh experienced double-digit growth in remittances in the first two or three quarters of 2008. El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic also saw remittance growth between 5 and 9 percent while Mexico had a 3.7 percent decrease.\nBut the average amount Mexican migrants in the United States send per transaction in 2008 ($349) remains in the $340-to-$350 range that has been the norm since 2005.\nAlso, despite a drop in remittances in August, Mexico's central bank reported an increase in September compared to the same month in 2007. And with the dollar stronger against the peso, even if the average transaction is holding steady, it nonetheless is providing greater buying power in Mexico.\nManuel Orozco, director of remittances and development at the Inter-American Dialogue, gives a number of reasons why Mexico's experience differs from those of other Latin American countries. These include job losses in the United States (particularly in the construction sector), a large drop in cash savings, a higher number of deportations resulting partly from worksite raids, and increased use of informal and alternative money-transfer methods that the Central Bank of Mexico does not properly record.\nDuring the U.S. recession of 2001-2002, remittances increased. The current recession, however, is expected to affect a larger number of developed countries and to be deeper and longer.\nRatha and his colleagues forecast that remittances as a share of GDP of the recipient countries will fall to 1.8 percent in 2008 from 2.0 percent in 2007. If realized, this would represent a remarkable turnaround in the growth trends of the past decade. The decline in remittances is expected to be short-lived, however, recovering to a growth rate of more than 6 percent by 2010.\nAnd the outlook for 2009, once all factors are considered? A slowdown in remittances in general, with some countries feeling the pain more than others.\nYet other kinds of external financial flows, such as foreign investment in emerging stock markets and official development assistance from governments, are likely to slow even more. That means remittances could become more important to developing countries even as their absolute value declines.\nFeatures South-South Migration and Remittances The Rise in Remittances to India: A Closer Look Latino Remittances Swell Despite U.S. Economic Slump (February 2003) How Remittances Help Migrant Families MPI Data Hub Global Remittances Guide MPI Variable Impacts: State-level Analysis of the Slowdown of the Growth in Remittances to Mexico (2007) Leveraging Remittances for Development Remittances and Development: Trends, Impacts, and Policy Options -- A Review of the Literature IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ABOUT THIS ARTICLE, CONTACT US AT [email protected]\nKirin Kalia is the Editorial Director at LAUNCH.
